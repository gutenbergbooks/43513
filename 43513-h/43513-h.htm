<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no doubt whatever but that every
little girl and every little boy has heard of the
country of Poland, and of its inhabitants the
Polacks, or Poles, as you hear them more often
spoken of. But there are countless numbers of
these same children, I fear, who have not the
slightest idea where Poland lies, except in a
most vague way; nor how the people live, what
they eat, what their pleasures and enjoyments
are, and how they dress. Of course, you say
at once, "Why, they eat the same things we
do; every one eats meat and vegetables, and
drinks milk or coffee," but right there you are
mistaken. The nations of other lands do <i>not</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
live as we do, for we are the most extravagant
nation in the whole world; indeed, other peoples
cannot afford to live like us, for most of
them are extremely poor; so poor and ignorant,
as applied to Polacks, that it would make your
heart ache to see them in their homes; they
know very little of happiness, and comfort is
a thing unknown to them, except for the
wealthy, landed class. But these Polish peasants
never think of complaining of their lot.
They accept it as their fate, to which they were
born; and, with light hearts, they make the
best of their surroundings and their holidays;
and I believe they derive more real pleasure
from their infrequent play-days than we are
able to do every day in our blessed, happy
lives.</p>

<p>The story of Poland, like the story of every
other nation, is not dry and dull. It is intensely
interesting. It reads like a fairy-tale, and I am
certain you will agree with me after you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
finished this little volume. I can but hope it
will give you a better and clearer understanding
of the life of the Polacks, not only as to the
rich, but to the poor.</p>

<h2>Our Little Polish Cousin</h2>


<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE ORIGIN OF POLAND</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> cross the Atlantic Ocean in one of the
great floating palaces which sail from New
York; after seven days of good times on board,
with not too much sea-sickness, we sight land,
the glorious, sunny land of France. We all
know and love France, for it has been endeared
to us in many ways. Lafayette helped us in our
time of need long years ago, and the French
school-children have given us that token of their
esteem, the Goddess of Liberty, which stands
at the entrance of the harbor in New York,
a welcome to all the poor, homeless refugees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and immigrants who come to this beloved land
of ours in search of rest.</p>

<p>After passing through the custom-house at
Havre, and our baggage being examined by the
officials in charge, to see that we have brought
nothing dutiable into their country, we board
the waiting train, and are whirled along by the
side of the sparkling river Seine, which winds
its way lazily among beautiful green fields under
the highest state of cultivation, mostly in vegetables,
until we reach the charming city of
Paris. As we may not linger here, much as we
should love to, we are off again in the morning.
We leave behind us the sunny, fair skies of
France and emerge into the peaceful country
of Germany with its rows upon rows of hops
so symmetrically strung upon high poles, and
its fertile vegetable gardens, where we see
whole families, from the old grandparents,
much too old to labor, down to the tiny but
sturdy four-year-old, bending over the growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
plants, weeding and hoeing and ridding of
plant-pests. To see the endless truck gardens,
as we pass by in the Schnell-zug (express train),
one would be justified in believing that the people
of Europe ate nothing but vegetables. And
it is quite true. The masses have little else to
feed upon, as meat is a rarity in poor families.
Even the salaried people are not able to afford
that luxury more than once a week, and then
it frequently happens that only the head of the
house may indulge.</p>

<p>As night descends, our train pulls in at the
depot at Dresden; but this is not Poland; a
little further, and we find ourselves in the city
of Cracow, the ancient city of Chief Krakus,
which we find nestled snugly and boldly at the
junction of the three powerful countries, Russia,
Austria-Hungary and Germany. It is here
we purpose spending a cycle of months visiting,
as Cracow is most typically Polish, with its
surrounding vicinities.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>What a glorious country we are in! It is
true, it is broad, and flat and low, with rugged
mountains and rapid rivers separating it, one
part from another; nevertheless, it is a wonderful
land. At one time it was a large country:
now it is divided into three parts, each belonging
to a different nation, the Russians, the Austrians
and the Germans. The conquering nations
have tried very hard to introduce their
own customs into this captive land, but the
Polacks will not accept them. We shall not
enter into this phase of the question, but will
visit the native as he is and not as the conquerors
would have him.</p>

<p>It is very much more interesting to know just
where the country lies about which we are reading,
so we shall first learn where Poland lies
upon the map of Europe. We open our books,
and search the map through, but there is no
country marked Poland. We are grieved to
say there is no longer any country by that name;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
it was not enough to wrest the country asunder,
but even its very name must be torn from it;
therefore, it is in the southwestern part of Russia,
the very northeast tip of Austria-Hungary,
and the ragged northeast portion of Germany
that we must trace the boundaries of Poland.
From Riga on the north to the Black Sea on
the south Poland had ample outlets for its great
quantities of wheat and sugar which it raised,
and which brought enormous wealth into the
country.</p>

<p>Everything must have a beginning, even
countries, and Poland was no exception. It
wasn't like Topsy, who wasn't ever born but
just "growed;" so here is the story of the
birth of Poland.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, oh, very long ago, there
lived a king or chief over the lands which lay
near the mouth of the Danube River. Now
you all know that the Danube rises at the Black
Sea on the west, quite close to the southern border<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of Russia. This chief had three sons, who
were great, strong men. At length the king
died, leaving his lands and all his wealth to
the care of these sons. Now, in those far-away
days, the tribes who lived thereabouts were
very savage; they had no learning or education.
All they cared for was to fight, and make
conquests of other nations so as to enlarge their
own possessions. When the three brothers
found themselves left with their father's small
domain, they were not satisfied. They could
not all rule upon the same throne and be at
peace, one with the other. The estate was too
small to divide into three separate kingdoms.
Consequently, they determined to go in search
of other lands which would be large enough to
satisfy their demands. They set out and journeyed
along happily for some time, meeting
with many dangers by the way, for the land
was full of wild beasts of all sorts, dangerous
reptiles and savage men, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
worse, indeed, than all the wild things of the
earth.</p>

<p>While walking along the highroad, one of
the brothers chanced to gaze upward. He
saw three eagles high in the air. He thought
nothing of this, however, for the air was
full of all sorts of birds, large and small.
But finally he noticed that the birds were
following along with them. At last the
brothers began to joke about the incident.</p>

<p>"I choose the white bird," said Lekh, the
eldest.</p>

<p>"And I the black one," said Russ.</p>

<p>"Then I must take the only one left," remarked
Tchekh. And, in this merry manner,
they passed the time as they continued their
march.</p>

<p>At length the travellers came to three roads,
diverging like the rays of a fan. One road led
to the north, the direction they were then pursuing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
another turned to the northeast, and the
third to the northwest.</p>

<p>"Which shall we take?" asked one of them,
as they halted their footsteps in order to decide
the important question.</p>

<p>"I am for going straight on," Lekh said.</p>

<p>"And I, too," spoke up the other. "There
is no use in separating so soon. Let us wait
a while!"</p>

<p>As they were arguing the point back and
forth, Lekh saw the white eagle, <i>his</i> eagle,
winging its way due north. The other two
birds were each following the direction of the
other two diverging roads.</p>

<p>"There goes your bird," Lekh said to his
brother Russ, as he pointed to the black eagle
flying toward the right. "Mine goes straight
onward, and so shall I. As for the rest of you,
you may do what you like."</p>

<p>"Then I shall follow my bird," Russ replied.
"Perhaps it will bring us good luck."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>So the three brothers bade one another an
affectionate farewell and parted. Russ followed
the black eagle until he came to the present
country of Russ-ia, which he founded and
named. Tchekh founded the country of Bohemia,
the people of which are even to-day
known as Czechs; as for Lekh, he wandered
due north until he came to the broad plain
where he settled. As his guide had been a
white eagle, he thought it but appropriate to
make that his emblem; and, in this way, it
happened that Poland has a white eagle upon
its flag.</p>

<p>Lekh, as I have just said, settled in an immense
plain, the Polish word for which is
"Pola." Then Lekh added his own name to
that, making Po-Lekh, sometimes written Lakh,
and now we have the word Po-lakh, meaning
the people of Lekh who lived in the plain.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE ARRIVAL AT THE DWÓR</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was snowing fast. The flakes fell in
great, thick showers about the occupants of the
heavy sleigh, who were fairly covered in a
blanket of white, crisp snow. The driver lashed
his sturdy, thoroughbred beasts with his long-handled
whip, for they were in danger of becoming
hopelessly sunk in the heavy drifts
which filled the road, and there were yet some
miles to go. The sleigh-bells jingled merrily,
nevertheless. What cared they whether they
were snow-bound or not, so long as they could
make their music ring out over the clear, frosty
air? It was their purpose in life to chime, and
they were doing their best. The harder the
horses tugged and the more they floundered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
about in the great drifts, the more merrily the
bells rang out. Some one must keep good-natured,
and so they took that task upon themselves.
Happy bells!</p>

<p>The horses panted and halted a moment for
the much-needed rest. The driver slapped his
great arms across his chest to keep the circulation
moving; but the occupants in the rear of
the sleigh made no motion whatever. For all
one could see of them, the sleigh might have
been empty except as to fur robes, for not even
the tip of a nose was visible. As the driver
called out to his team, "Gee up," one corner
of the fur robe in the rear seat moved, and a
little voice piped up:</p>

<p>"Mother, are we almost there?"</p>

<p>"Just a little while yet, my dear," the mother
replied, as she raised her head from the protecting
warmth of the robe and looked about
her. "I can see the tall trees of the drive now,
just ahead of us. Peep your head out, Jan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and see if you can catch sight of grandfather's
dwór," said Mrs. Teczynska, as she rearranged
the robes so that Jan could sit upright.</p>

<p>Before them, some mile away, lay an immense
park enclosed within a high stone fence. The
sleigh made headway easier now, for the road
about the entrance to the dwór was in better
condition than the ordinary public road. Soon
they passed the stone brama or gateway, sped
down the splendid broad driveway lined on
both sides with overhanging trees, mounted the
rise at the top, and with a whoop and a hurrah,
the driver pulled rein at the porch of the dwór
or country-home of Mr. Ostrowski, the father
of Mrs. Teczynska.</p>

<p>The tinkle of the sleigh bells had announced
the arrival of the guests long before they had
reached the porch; and the entire family, big
and little, with innumerable servants, were
awaiting within the reception-hall to greet the
newcomers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The villa was just the hospitable-looking
home in which to meet at the Christmas season.
One knew, from its very appearance, that it
sheltered a warm welcome. It was built of
stone, was two stories high and had a red-tiled
roof; red chimneys dotted it all over; you
never did see so many chimneys all on one
house before. There was an immense veranda
running along the entire front of the house,
supported by heavy columns, giving it a most
substantial air, the air of a home and not merely
an expensive residence.</p>

<p>Mr. Ostrowski assisted his daughter and the
little grandson Jan to disentangle themselves
from the heavy fur robes, and they were hurried
into the warm reception-room, where a
bright fire was burning on an open hearth. As
Mrs. Teczynska passed through the massive
front door, which was opened for her by an
elderly, not to say old, man-servant, she greeted
him kindly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"And how does Henryk find himself?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/i031.jpg" width="337" height="500" alt="man leaning down to kiss little girl's hand" />
<span class="caption">&quot;<span class="smcap">Henryk Leaned Down and Kissed the Hand of
the Little Fellow</span>&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The old man, toothless and very infirm,
bowed respectfully.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mlle. Martha, I keep very
well; but it does my old eyes good to see you
once more. How you have grown!"</p>

<p>"This is the little Jan, Henryk," Mrs.
Teczynska said, as she drew her little son toward
the old man. Henryk leaned down and kissed
the hand of the little fellow, and tears dimmed
his eyes. He had been an old and trusted servant
of the family for many, many years, long
before Mrs. Teczynska had been born, and
was now relegated to the position of doorkeeper,
being much too infirm for other duties.
Although it is not necessary to have a man sitting
in attendance at the front door, yet it is
the Polish custom in the upper circles, so as to
give employment to as many peasants as possible,
and for this service, they receive but a
pittance, yet it suffices. It makes the aged feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
independent, and that they are not a burden in
the already overburdened family.</p>

<p>What a happy reunion! Such hugging and
bustle! All the children of the Ostrowski family
were once more gathered together under the
home-roof for the Christmas season, which was
now at the beginning.</p>

<p>Mr. Ostrowski, the father, was a tall man of
spare build; he had the kind, blue eye of the
Slav and his heavy head of brown hair was
tinged slightly with white. He wore a long
coat, quite resembling a dressing-gown, edged
with fur about the bottom and along the front,
and tied about his waist with a long sash of
crimson silk. This was the house costume of
Mr. Ostrowski, who leaned toward the former
luxurious style of dress in Poland.</p>

<p>His wife was a handsome woman, even in
her elderly years; her complexion was as fresh
and rosy as a young matron's, and her eye as
soft a blue as in her younger days. The Polish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
women of culture do not age; they live a life
of luxury and ease, and Time is gentle with
them. But for all their seeming idleness they
devote many hours of each day among their
poor, and Mrs. Ostrowska was no exception to
this rule.</p>

<p>Besides the father and mother, there was
the younger brother, Peter, a tall, manly-looking
fellow of about sixteen years, and Marya,
the young sister, who had just passed her fourteenth
birthday. Then there was the married
sister, Mrs. Lechowicz, her husband and two
sons, Francis and Frederic, and the oldest
brother, Jan Ostrowski, with his wife and two
children, Ignace and Marcella. You may well
believe there was much to tell each other, and
a great deal of commotion, for the married
children lived in dwórs of their own or in
the city, and were separated, not only by
distance, but by family cares and business
interests, so that it was not more often than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
at the Christmas season they were able to
meet.</p>

<p>Jan Teczynski was overwhelmed with so
many cousins and aunts and uncles; he was but
five years old, and had not made their acquaintance
before. He gazed about him in wonderment
at all he saw; he could not withdraw his
big, blue eyes from the immense boar's head
which decorated the chimney-piece, and he
asked all sorts of questions concerning it. It
amused the older children immensely to hear
him ask who had killed it. When told his
grandfather had done so, he was very proud to
think that <i>his</i> grandfather had been so brave;
then he wanted to know if the boar had hurt
grandfather with his sharp, curved tusks; but
Mr. Ostrowski laughingly told him he had not
been harmed, whereupon Jan seemed much relieved.
But when he inquired if grandfather
was sure the boar had been quite dead before
he had cut off its head, the other children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
burst into roars of merriment. Jan didn't
think it a matter to laugh over at all, but
from that day he regarded his grandfather
as one of the bravest men in the whole
world.</p>

<p>The young folks now made off for sports
of their own, while Mrs. Teczynska, much fatigued
after her long and tiresome journey,
went at once to her room to rest before luncheon
should be served.</p>

<p>The maid-servant carried up the valises and
bags of Mrs. Teczynska and set them down in
the room that she had occupied from childhood.
Fresh, hot water being brought by yet another
maid, and cool drinking water placed upon the
night-stand by the side of the great bed, the
servants retired and left Mrs. Teczynska alone
in her old, familiar room.</p>

<p>It was a very large room, as are all the rooms
in Polish homes. The floor was beautifully
inlaid in a fancy design with hardwoods of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
colors, and polished so highly one had to walk
carefully so as not to fall. Against one wall
stood a magnificent stove of white glazed tile,
with a door of shining brass, most exquisitely
designed, and which could be closed so tightly
that not one bit of dust or ash could penetrate
through into the room. The peculiarity of this
stove was, that only half of it was in the room;
the other half extended into the adjoining room,
so that, in this manner, one stove did duty for
two rooms, thus saving expense, space and
chimneys. It reached, too, quite to the ceiling;
but, as the ceiling was low, it was not as tall
as many other European stoves.</p>

<p>And the bed! It looked quite like any other
wooden bed, but what a covering! There were
no sheets or blankets such as we have. Instead,
there was a blue silk comforter of down, so
light you would have thought there was nothing
in it, daintily tied here and there with little
strands of silk. This silk comforter was put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
over a white linen sheet, much larger every way
than the comforter; the edges were then folded
over the silk and buttoned to it, the button-holes
being worked in the border of the sheet and
the buttons placed upon the comforter. At the
top, which we usually turn over the blanket,
the sheet was shaped like a triangle. In the
middle of the point was worked the monogram
of the hostess, while the remainder of the space
was filled with the most elaborate and exquisite
embroidery imaginable, done by the young
peasant girls upon the estate. This was not
a "company" sheet; no, indeed, not at all;
the same kind was used every day in the week
and in the year. The pillows, too, were covered
with blue silk, and over this was buttoned,
just to fit, a handsome pillow-case all inset with
lace insertion so that the color of the silk beneath
might show through. What a luxurious
bed in which to sleep! It certainly was inviting.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>In one corner of the room stood a small altar
to the Holy Virgin, upon which stood freshly
gathered flowers from the greenhouses of the
estate, and wax candles were burning. As the
majority of the Polacks are Roman Catholics,
these altars are found in almost every home,
each bedroom having its own altar for its occupant's
special devotion.</p>

<p>Four large windows, opening inwards like
double doors, looked over the covered veranda
without, toward the fields stretching as far as
the eye could see, covered now with their blanket
of snow, while further yet lay great forests,
the tops of whose trees were barely discernible
in the dim distance.</p>

<p>Just below the windows lay a most magnificent
garden, with fountains and bordered walks;
but they, too, like everything else, lay under
their blanket of winter's white. The ponds
beyond, which supplied the estate with fresh
fish, were frozen solid, and here the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
had gone for an hour's skating in the crisp
air, while their childish voices carried up to
where Mrs. Teczynska lay resting upon her
couch.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SENDING OF THE OPLATKI</div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the luncheon table there was great excitement.
Something was astir in the air.</p>

<p>"Take your time, children," Mr. Ostrowski
said forcibly, as he watched their hurried anxiety.
"Brother Paul will be here shortly;
but there is p-l-e-n-t-y of time."</p>

<p>"We wish he had come before luncheon,"
spoke up Peter. "It is now almost too late for
Cousin Frederic to receive his oplatki before
Christmas."</p>

<p>"A few hours more or less, my son," Mrs.
Ostrowska answered, "will make very little
difference. We could not have Brother Paul
come sooner because we were waiting for your
sister to arrive. We all wanted to be together
to receive the good Brother."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning toward her eldest daughter, Mrs.
Lechowicz, she continued:</p>

<p>"Brother Paul, as well as the priest, has had
his hands full this winter. There has been a
great deal of sickness among the poor."</p>

<p>"It has been so in our part of the country,
too," replied the daughter. "It seems to be
a bad year all round."</p>

<p>"The crops are poor; but we are thankful
to say there will be sufficient for our own people.
What the rest of Poland's poor will do,
it is difficult to say. I had planned to take the
children to Cracow for St. John's Night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, mother," interrupted the young Marya,
"will you?"</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt, Marya; it is very bad
manners. I was going to say," Mrs. Ostrowska
continued, addressing her children, "I had
planned to take you to the feast of St. John's
Night in the City if all went well upon the estate.
But I know you would not care to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and enjoy yourselves if there were sickness and
distress here at home among our people."</p>

<p>"But June is so far away," the young girl
pleaded, "there is yet lots of time for a good
season."</p>

<p>"But illness lingers," the mother added.</p>

<p>"I will join you, mother," Mrs. Teczynska
spoke up. "It will not be a long run up and
Jan would love to see the celebration of the
Wianki, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Let us all plan to go," added the younger
married daughter. "It would be great fun."</p>

<p>"And will you take us?" added a chorus
of young voices from around the great table,
while expectant faces beamed.</p>

<p>"Yes, all of you," the elders replied in one
voice.</p>

<p>"What is it all about, mother?" Jan managed
to say, after vainly endeavoring for some
time to edge in his question.</p>

<p>"Once every year," Mrs. Teczynska replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
"in the city of Cracow, where we got off the
train and took the sleigh to come up here, the
people have a holiday. They call it the celebration
of the Wianki, or wreaths, and it takes
place on the twenty-fourth day of June, which
is the eve of St. John's Night. They have fireworks
and all sorts of gayeties."</p>

<p>"But what does it all mean?" the child persisted.</p>

<p>"Well," his mother continued, seeing that
the child did not comprehend as the older children
did, "many, many years ago there was
a good and very wise king in Cracow named
Krakus. He had a most beautiful daughter,
Wanda, who was so handsome that the fame
of her beauty travelled all over the country.
Princes and noblemen from other lands sent
their messengers to ask her hand in marriage;
but the Princess Wanda did not care for any
of them. At length, a fierce, determined German
prince, named Rytyger, fell so madly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
love with the princess that he swore he would
win her for his own. But the father of the
princess had meantime died, leaving her in full
possession of the kingdom; and, whether it was
really the fair princess Rytyger craved, or the
kingdom over which she ruled, we may not
know for a certainty. However that may be,
he sent his messengers to ask her hand in marriage,
but the Princess Wanda promptly refused
his offer. As soon as the envoys returned
with the refusal, Prince Rytyger was more
determined than ever to possess the Polish
princess. He wrote her a most impertinent
letter, demanding that she become his wife at
once or else he would march into her domains
and carry her off, whether she were willing or
not. The Princess Wanda read the letter from
the haughty German prince. She set her lips
hard with firm determination. If <i>he</i> were determined,
so was she. Without a moment's
loss of time, she gathered her army together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
marched out of Poland and into the country
of the German prince. She sent word to him
of her arrival, and added that she meant to give
battle. The prince was very much surprised
at this news, you may be certain; however,
there was nothing to do but accept the challenge
so long as he had been the one to open the argument.
After the battle was finished many
of the Germans were left upon the field, while
Wanda returned to her castle-fortress of Wawel
in Cracow.</p>

<p>"Seeing there was no use to refuse the offers
of marriage that were made her, and fearing
that other foreign princes might come into her
land and wage war against her subjects on her
account, she jumped from the top of the great
stone wall that surrounded her palace, and fell
into the river Vistula, which runs at the foot.
And ever since, the Polish people have commemorated
her death by casting wreaths into
the river, at about the spot where Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Wanda jumped into the waters. This is the
meaning of the feast of St. John's Eve celebration
of the Wianki."</p>

<p>"I should love to see it," the little fellow
said, after a few moments' silence. "Will you
surely take me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, if the other little cousins go,"
his mother replied. "When I was a little girl,
like your Aunt Marya here," she continued,
glancing at her young sister, "I went to the
celebration. And you will open your eyes wide,
Jan, I'll tell you that."</p>

<p>"Oh, goody, I wish it was the twenty-fourth
of June now."</p>

<p>"But we have the Christmas season now,"
his grandfather spoke up. "That is much better,
for we are all together. We have the fine
snow for sleighing and snowballing. We have
the ponds to skate upon, and we have&mdash;the
Jaselki."</p>

<p>"What's that?" little Jan asked.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jan, dear," his mother said, "please do
not ask so many questions. Let your grandfather
finish before you interrupt."</p>

<p>"But he says so many things I don't know
anything about," the child answered.</p>

<p>"That is right, Martha," Mr. Ostrowski
said, "let the little chap learn. Of course he
doesn't know what the Jaselki are, for he is
too little to know everything. But that is a
secret, Jan," the grandfather continued, as he
shook a gentle finger at the boy. "You will see
something wonderful at this Christmas season."</p>

<p>The maid entered; she said a few words in
a low tone to Mrs. Ostrowska, and left the
room.</p>

<p>"How we have lingered!" the grandmother
said, as she rose from her seat at the table.
"Brother Paul has been waiting some little
time. Let us all rise to greet him!"</p>

<p>As they obeyed, the door at the farther end
of the long dining-room opened, and a monk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
clad in a long black robe with a girdle of rope
about his waist, stood upon the threshold. In
his hand he held his black beaver hat, and
under his arm was a small package upon which
the children kept their eyes assiduously glued.</p>

<p>"Welcome, Brother Paul," Mr. Ostrowski
said as he greeted the monk. "The little folks
have been in a fever of impatience; you are
well come."</p>

<p>"I hear the same story in every home," the
monk replied, as he turned and smiled at the
row of happy faces. "They are all anxious for
their oplatki."</p>

<p>"Let us go into the library," Mr. Ostrowski
said, as he threw open the heavy doors communicating
with that room; "the fire burns
brightly there, and you must be cold."</p>

<p>"It certainly is raw without," the monk replied.
"We are to have a long, hard winter,
I fear."</p>

<p>"We just arrived this morning, Brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Paul," Mrs. Teczynska said. "We had a
dreadfully cold ride from Cracow. I thought
little Jan's nose would be nipped."</p>

<p>"Come here, son, and let's see if Jack Frost
got away with any of it," the monk said.</p>

<p>The little fellow obeyed with a very serious
face. He had quite an awe for the brotherhood;
he held up his face for inspection.</p>

<p>"I believe it's all there," the brother laughingly
said, as he examined the boy's serious
face. "But you had a narrow escape."</p>

<p>Brother Paul drew up to the great table in
the centre of the room, having sufficiently
warmed his numbed hands at the welcome fire.
Surrounded by the anxious, waiting children
he untied the package he had brought. With
keen interest they watched the monk draw forth
a neat packet which he handed to Mr. Ostrowski,
who untied it. Within, lay a quantity of
small, round wafers, thin enough to be almost
transparent, made from flour and water, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
each of which was impressed a religious picture.
Upon one was the image of the Christ,
another bore the resemblance of the manger,
or of a saint.</p>

<p>"I shall get mine off right away," Peter said.
"May I?" turning to his father.</p>

<p>Seeing there was no holding back the children's
impetuosity, Mrs. Ostrowska handed the
children some of the oplatki, which they at once
proceeded to enclose in letters already waiting.</p>

<p>"I hope Cousin Frederic will get this before
Christmas Day," Peter said, "but it is pretty
late."</p>

<p>The rest of the afternoon was spent in writing
letters and sending off the oplatki or Christmas
cards to such of the relatives as were unable
to be present with the family at this season.
It is as much an event in Polish families to send
these cards as it is with us; they bear messages
of love and good-will, although they have no
verses upon them. The priest of the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
has put his blessing upon them, and these blessings
go forth to the dear, absent ones. No written
sentiment is necessary, for the absent know
that the home-folks are thinking of them. It
is a beautiful custom, and if it should happen
that any of you children should receive an
oplatki at the Christmas season, you will know
what it is meant to convey.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of you more observant readers
have remarked the difference in spelling the
name of Mr. Ostrowski and his wife. While
Mr. Ostrowski's name ends in "i," his wife's
name ends with an "a;" this is simply a peculiarity
of the Polish language, being the masculine
and feminine ending of the name.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHRISTMAS AT THE DWÓR</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Teczynski</span> arrived the day before
Christmas; business had detained him until
then. Jan was delighted to see his father again,
from whom he had never been separated so
long. Three weeks seemed a very long time
to him. He had had such a glorious time at
grandfather's, though, with the new cousins
and the uncles and the aunts, he had quite forgotten
everybody and everything, except when
bedtime came. Then he missed his father
greatly, for there was no one to tell him his
customary stories, and Papa Teczynski was a
famous story-teller.</p>

<p>There was no one at home to receive Mr.
Teczynski, except little Jan; the entire family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
had gone to the village to attend service. But
then, Jan's father did not mind that; he was
glad to be alone with his little son for a while;
they had so many things to tell each other, and
the time passed too rapidly. They did not even
notice that the hour was getting late and that
the electric lamps were lighted, nor did they
hear the return of the others from their devotions.
There is no festival in the land of Poland
which is observed with as much rigor and
ceremony as that of the Christmas season. Almost
the entire day is spent in fasting and
prayer, after which comes the evening meal.</p>

<p>Scarcely were the family returned, and the
greetings over between them and the new arrival,
than dinner was announced. With great
ceremony, they formed in line, the father and
mother leading the way, and in this most formal
manner the family procession passed through
the high folding doors opening from the library
into the immense dining-hall. There were few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
occasions during the year when the younger
children were allowed the privilege of sitting
at the dinner table with their parents; and
these occasions were most awe-inspiring to
them. But upon this Christmas Eve there was
an atmosphere of reserve and restraint in the
attitude of the elders which had its quieting
effect upon the younger ones, as they brought
up the rear of the line and seated themselves
about the great table. At a glance, one could
readily see that something was different from
the ordinary course of events. The air was
heavy with the scene of fresh hay, which lay
in a thick padding under the table cloth, and
in various parts of the large room. Straw was
upon the sideboard, straw upon the window-sills,
and some was even sprinkled lightly about
the highly polished floor, as though dropped
carelessly.</p>

<p>The usually gorgeously decorated dining-table
was now quite devoid of all ornamentation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
not even a bouquet of flowers brightened the
centre of the board. Christmas, for Polish
families, means fasting and prayer, and not
feasting; it is looked upon as a day apart for
the observance of religious rites, and to keep
before their minds the memory of their Christ
and his life of self-denial and goodness.</p>

<p>There was no gayety in the conversation
about the table during the meal; all was as
solemn and reserved as though some great sorrow
had descended upon the family. In almost
absolute silence the various courses were
brought in and partaken of. Meat was prohibited
during this day, but, as if to make up
for this deficiency, there were many courses of
soups and fish, so that the bill-of-fare was exceedingly
lengthy and somewhat tedious.</p>

<p>Not content with serving one kind of soup,
there were as many as three upon this occasion,
and it was no uncommon thing to serve several
more, in very pretentious homes where the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of the house did not consider it unseemly to
waste of his plenty. There was a delicious
soup made from almonds, then one called
barszcz, which was made of fish, and a third
made from the juice of beets, which had been
allowed to ferment, giving the soup a very sour
taste; and, while neither you nor I may care
for this sort of broth, yet the Polacks are very
fond of it, and have honored it by making it
the national soup of the country.</p>

<p>The soup course finished, fish is served.
There is tench and pike and carp, besides herring
and several kinds of smaller fish, mostly
from the great ponds just at the back of the
manor-house. It might seem a bit monotonous
to eat such quantities of fish at one meal, but
each was served with a different kind of gravy
or sauce, which quite changed the taste of the
dish. Besides, there were vegetables which
accompanied them, each differing from the
other with each course: mushrooms, and lettuce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and cabbages. Plebeian as it may sound to the
ears of American children, who are brought up
in such a luxuriant manner, the cabbage is a
great factor in Polish menus; not being confined
to the tables of the poor alone, either.</p>

<p>Salads are now served, with crisp lettuce or
water-cress, and a most delicious dish known
as "kutia," which is made from oats and honey
with poppy seeds added, to give it zest. This
is the national dish of the Lithuanians, who
have annexed their province to that of Poland.</p>

<p>At last we have arrived at the dessert; but,
as puddings and pies are unknown upon the
Continent, dessert, or "sweets," as the Polacks
call it, consists of fruit, both uncooked and conserved,
and a variety of small cakes, or pirogi
which are filled with almond paste, or, sometimes,
cheese or other toothsome combinations
such as poppy seeds, of which the Polacks are
very fond.</p>

<p>The meal is finished; the hour draws near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
that marks the close of day. And now, as a
last addition to the feast, the oplatki are
broken, each with the other, just as we are
accustomed to call out in the wee, small hours
of the night, "Merry Christmas," and in this
manner do the Polacks wish each other all the
compliments of the season.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ostrowska arose from the table first;
the children knew full well where she was
going, and they eagerly hastened for their
heavy wraps and fur caps. Then the little procession
filed down the road to the bottom of
the hill, merrily singing carols and Christmas
hymns, passing from house to house breaking
the wafers with the peasants and wishing them
all sorts of good things for the coming year.
This custom brings master and mistress closer
to the tenants, and forms between them a bond
of brotherhood.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ostrowska stroked one young girl gently
under the chin, as she said:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"This will be your last Christmas under the
home-roof, Emilia?"</p>

<p>"I hope so," the girl replied blushingly, as
she curtsied and kissed the finger-tips of her
patroness. "Francois and I are to be married
at the Easter time."</p>

<p>"And then the young sister Helena will find
her young man?"</p>

<p>"I hope so," the young girl reiterated.</p>

<p>"We shall be on the lookout for some
fine fellow for her," Mrs. Ostrowska said
lightly. "There are some very fine young
men over to the village at the east of the estate;
we must see what we can do," and
she moved on, the troop of children at her
heels.</p>

<p>Their round of the village over, the whole
party returned to the dwór, where they found
a servant carrying away the straw which had
adorned the dining-hall.</p>

<p>The man stopped as he encountered the mistress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of the house, and bowed his head, as if
in apology.</p>

<p>"Our cow was taken ill last night, Madame,"
he explained guiltily. "We thought, perhaps,
this might bring her back to health again. We
need her milk for the babies. May I?" and
he questioned his mistress' face hopefully.</p>

<p>"Take it and welcome," the latter replied
kindly, "and may you realize your hopes."
Well she knew the superstitions of the peasants
in regard to the straw from the Christmas
table, which was now supposed to be holy.
They had been taught from childhood, and for
centuries back from one generation to another
had the story been handed down, that this
straw possessed remarkable virtues and would
not only cure illness in cattle but ward off evil
spirits from their homes. It is a harmless delusion,
and Mrs. Ostrowska did not interfere
in any way with the beliefs of her people. She
had even known them to tie the sacred straw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
about the trunks of the fruit trees, when scale
would attack them, and if it chanced that they
bore well the following year, they attributed it
entirely to the efficacy of the straw.</p>

<p>The younger children were now sent off to
bed, while the older ones, with their parents,
awaited the hour of Pasterka, or midnight
mass.</p>

<p>Service over, in the dim light of early morning,
the occupants of the manor made their way
slowly homewards on foot. They passed
groups of peasant girls, shawls over their
heads, loitering on their way to their homes.</p>

<p>"For what are they waiting, mother?"
Marya asked, as she noticed that the girls were
evidently lingering for an object.</p>

<p>"They are waiting to accost the first young
man they meet," the mother replied, "in order
to learn his name."</p>

<p>"But what for?" asked Marya a second
time.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is a peasant custom," the mother answered.
"Whatever name is given her, she
believes that that will be the name of the man
she is destined to marry with. As the girls do
not meet with many strangers outside of their
own village, it is quite a certainty that they will
eventually happen to wed with the one accosted."</p>

<p>"I should like to learn who my future husband
will be," the girl said, somewhat in an
undertone, scarce daring to voice her wish.</p>

<p>"Marya!" the mother reproved. "What
ideas! There is no harm in a peasant girl stopping
a stranger on the road upon Christmas
Eve; but for you to do so would be unpardonable."</p>

<p>"But I'm a child, mother, too," she persisted,
"just as they are children. I don't see
any harm in it. It's all in fun, anyway. Please
let me," she pleaded, "just this once."</p>

<p>"No, Marya," the mother replied, in a tone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of finality. "But you may draw near so as to
listen to the girls as they address this young
man who approaches around the turn," and
the two moved closer toward the knot of village
maidens, tittering and giggling among
themselves, as they slowly wended their way
along the road, half-lingering so that the eligible
might overtake them, as if by accident.</p>

<p>"Good evening, sir," the eldest of them said,
half timidly, almost afraid of her own boldness,
for peasant maidens are modest, "and
may I know your name?"</p>

<p>The young man stopped; he swept his fur
cap from his head with a lordly air, and replied:</p>

<p>"With pleasure, mademoiselle. Thaddeus."</p>

<p>The village girls tittered; the young man
replaced his cap upon his thick hair, and passed
on. The "fun" was over until the next
"victim" should appear for the next young
lady. Every one understands this Christmas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Eve custom, and no one would think, even for
one instant, of violating its freedom by forcing
attention upon the unescorted young girls.</p>

<p>"It wasn't a bit pretty name at all," Marya
said. "I'm glad <i>I</i> didn't ask him. I should
not like to have <i>my</i> husband's name Thaddeus."</p>

<p>"Don't say that, Marya," the mother reproved gently,
"for you know that one of
Poland's grandest men was named Thaddeus;
Kosciuszco, I mean."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I know," the young girl answered;
nevertheless she knew it was not a name
she would choose for her own particular swain
were she able to make her choice. However,
she wisely said nothing, but walked briskly
along by her mother's side, believing that, perhaps,
her mother had been quite right in the
matter.</p>

<p>There was very little sleep, if any, for the
family the remainder of the night, or rather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
morning. No sooner were they arrived at their
home and in their beds, than they were awakened
by the shouts of the younger children,
who pranced about the house in their night-robes
in a most injudicious manner. There was
music somewhere; some one was singing the
kolendy, or Christmas carol. At length the
music was discovered to issue from beneath one
of the windows in the rear of the house. Pressing
their faces against the cold panes, the children
saw below them a most wonderful sight.
A group of men were singing as they accompanied
themselves upon various instruments.
Some of them were clad in long, flowing robes,
with hair descending upon their shoulders, who
represented characters in the Bible, at the time
of Christ's life; others wore the aspect of
birds, all decked out with gay plumage, and
yet another man, the one who wore a golden
crown upon his white hair, waved aloft a long
wand, upon the very top of which rested a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
golden star which sparkled in the dim light of
the frosty morning.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/i067.jpg" width="340" height="500" alt="Children throwing coins out window to procession" />
<span class="caption">&quot;<span class="smcap">The Little Ones Threw Quantities of Small Coins</span>&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>As soon as he saw the children at the windows
he held out his hands, into which the little
ones threw quantities of small coins begged
from their elders. With profound thanks the
procession moved on, still singing their kolendy,
while the children crept back to their beds, but
not to sleep. The Gwiazda, or "Star," had
been too much excitement for their little heads,
and for full an hour they talked in muffled
voices about the wonderful Star of Bethlehem
and the queer antics of the men in the cocks'
feathers.</p>

<p>Christmas Day dawned; the fasting and penance
were finished; merry-making could begin.
But, unlike the little American cousin, the Polish
cousin does not celebrate Christmas Day
with a tree and gifts and romping. It is for
him strictly a religious day; there is no gift-giving,
these being reserved for his birthdays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
which are made occasions for great festivity.
And this custom prevails throughout nearly, if
not all, the countries in Europe; the birthday
is more thought of and celebrated with great
gayety than any other holiday in the year.</p>

<p>The day wore on quietly. The older folks
sat in the library about the roaring fire and
chatted or read, while the younger ones spent
their time out of doors, snowballing, sledding
and skating.</p>

<p>After luncheon little Jan said:</p>

<p>"Grandfather, you never told me your secret
yet, and Christmas Day is almost over."</p>

<p>"What secret?" asked the grandfather,
somewhat astonished.</p>

<p>"We know," rang out a small chorus from
the older ones.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember what you told me the
day I came? You said I should see something
wonderful; you told me the name, but I don't
remember, it was such a big one."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Mr. Ostrowski replied slowly, as
he stroked his chin and a merry twinkle came
into his eye. "The Jaselki. I had quite forgotten."</p>

<p>"Then we shall not have it," Jan said disappointedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you shall," his grandfather replied.
"It will come just the same. I have
already arranged for it. But I wonder what
keeps them?" And he pulled out his watch
and looked at it.</p>

<p>"The snow is very deep, and the roads bad,"
Mrs. Ostrowska said, as she looked out of the
window toward the avenue of linden trees.
"There is no one in sight yet."</p>

<p>"Maybe they won't come," Jan said doubtingly.</p>

<p>"They always do," his grandfather replied.
"They haven't missed a single year. But it
is only three o'clock; there is plenty of time."</p>

<p>"Will it come by the road?" Jan asked.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; that is the only way it can come,"
his grandfather said.</p>

<p>"Then I shall watch," the child said. "When
I see them I shall call you."</p>

<p>Jan seated himself at the library window so
that he might be able to look far down the wide
road leading to the entrance of the park. There
was silence for a long time. Then he suddenly
called out:</p>

<p>"What will they look like, grandfather?"</p>

<p>"They will come in a covered wagon," Mr.
Ostrowski answered.</p>

<p>Silence again. After some little time, Jan
called out excitedly:</p>

<p>"I see them; they have just come through
the brama."</p>

<p>Such a jumping and scampering as there was
then in the great house! There was no holding
the children back from running out to the front
porch to meet the arrivals. It was indeed a
peculiar-looking crowd that made its appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
A huge wagon, mounted on runners,
most gorgeously decorated with tinsel of gold
and silver, and covered with strings upon
strings of tiny bells, was making its way slowly
up the driveway. Had it been a little American
child who had seen it, he would at once
have remarked that it was a circus-wagon. The
sleigh bells jingled merrily; and, as the wagon
pulled up at the entrance of the manor, the
driver smiled pleasantly at the children's welcome.
He knew Peter and Marya well, for
he had come every year to their home upon
Christmas Day to present his plays. He nodded
to them and wished them a happy Christmastide;
he bowed respectfully to the other children,
with whom he was unacquainted, for he
considered all children as his own peculiar
property.</p>

<p>Before the wondering eyes of the excited
children, the driver and his assistants set up
the show. They watched them, with wide-opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
eyes, light the numberless small candles
about the stage arch; the gold and silver tinsel
now sparkled out like a miniature fairy-land.
The old horse would look around every little
while, as though trained to do so, to see that
everything was being done in an approved manner.
This set the strings of bells to vibrating,
so that their melody rang out over the snow,
attracting the attention of the peasants in the
village beyond, who promptly gathered to witness
the exhibition.</p>

<p>Jaselki means a manger; and because these
travelling showmen give scenes from the life
of Christ they are called jaselki, or manger-men.
For over an hour the children, not to mention
the grown folks, were fascinated by the miracle-play.
Then, the entertainment over, the
men were ushered into the servants' quarters,
where they received warm food and drink, after
which they packed up their wagon and departed
for Cracow, where they were to give more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
representations during the evening upon the
rynek, or public square.</p>

<p>It is only at Christmas that these plays are
given; during other seasons of the year these
showmen present other sorts of entertainments,
so that from one year's end to the other, they
travel about in their gorgeously decorated wagons,
sometimes on wheels, sometimes on runners,
living in the open air, the life of nomads.
Christmas Day is over. Night descends and
quiet reigns at the dwór. The great house is
early wrapped in slumber, and thus ends the
holiday season.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE VISIT TO THE GAILY PAINTED COTTAGE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A day</span> or two later, the guests departed, and
the Ostrowski family took up its daily routine.
The boy Peter resumed his studies under the
care and instruction of his tutor, while the little
Marya returned to the guidance of her governess,
for each child in a wealthy family in
Poland has his or her own tutor or tutoress.
Child life in upper circles is quite a thing apart
from the lives of the grown-ups. Their hours
are widely different; they dress simply and live
simply, receiving instruction in the arts and
languages; the girls to be fine housekeepers
and womanly; the boys to be courteous, manly
and well versed in those matters which pertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to the care and interest of the estate which is
later to devolve upon their shoulders.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ostrowska never breakfasted with her
children. She rose about eleven o'clock, had
her morning meal in her own rooms, and after
tending to her household duties, devoted the
better part of the afternoon to the needs of her
peasantry. She was a very charitable woman,
as are all the upper-class Polacks, and devoted
many hours among these people. She had sewing
classes for the young girls, where they were
taught to do, not only the plain sewing necessary
for their own use, but embroidery of the
most exquisite kind, so that they might employ
their idle moments, during the long, cold winter
days, in making articles to sell in the cities.
Furthermore, she established cooking classes;
she aided the sick; and doctors being very far
away, the mistress of the manor was usually
called upon in case of illness among the peasantry;
even the children were taught that most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
useful and beneficial branch of science, first aid
to the injured. Were it not for the generosity
and far-sightedness of the landed proprietors
in looking after the interests and education of
these peasants, there would be most abject poverty
and suffering among them.</p>

<p>The Ostrowski estate is one of the oldest in
Poland; it numbers fully four hundred thousand
acres; and, in order to grasp the immensity
of this, you must know that one ordinary
city block measures five acres, so that it
would require about six hundred and twenty-five
blocks each way to cover this enormous
estate. And you may be quite certain, it is no
small task to properly look after and make
profitable an estate of this size.</p>

<p>There is a distillery which distils spirits from
the potatoes raised upon one portion of the
estate; there is a sugar refinery, which transforms
the juicy red beets into snowy white
sugar; there are cotton-mills, which are kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
going by the thousands of bales of soft, fluffy
cotton grown upon the place; there are endless
factories and mills of every description, all
under the care of the master of the manor.
He would much prefer not to add these industries
to his business cares, but he is a charitable
man; he knows that to every rich man
there are thousands of poor. If the beets and
the potatoes, the grain and the cotton were
allowed to go out in their raw state, for manufacture
elsewhere, there would be many workmen
thrown out of employment. Perhaps
these same poor might be compelled to seek
their fortunes in our own beloved land, and
this would mean the loss of many valuable
citizens, who will be wanted some day, to stand
up for Poland and help her win back her lost
liberty. Therefore, Mr. Ostrowski, having a
clear head, decided to use his products upon
his land, and, in this way, he gave employment
to thousands of families, for not only were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
men put to work at the heavier tasks, but the
women helped out with the spinning and the
lighter tasks.</p>

<p>The villages attached to the Ostrowski estate
are model ones. They are naturally situated
at great distances apart, each village clustering
itself about the particular factory near
by. The huts nestle snugly at the foot of the
hill upon which stands the dwór, as if they
craved protection from their superior. In
groups of two and threes they huddle together,
these low-roofed, whitewashed, plastered
houses, a door in the centre, a window at
either side affording scant light to the two
rooms within. The European peasants seem
greatly to object to admitting light into their
home; perhaps it is but the lingering custom
of barbaric days when man feared to present
an entrance into his sacred precincts to a possible
enemy; perhaps it is but the relic of an
ancient law, but recently repealed in France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
that every opening, be it door or window, giving
upon the street or road, is taxed; and if
there is one bugbear in the vocabulary of the
peasant, it is "taxes."</p>

<p>A bit of a garden lies in front of each home,
while at the rear is the truck garden, where
enough vegetables are raised to last during the
winter season. Some of the more prosperous
tenants possess a cow, or a pig, or perhaps
even a goose; nevertheless, whatever the size
of the family, brute and otherwise, they all
live in harmony and happiness together in the
two low-ceiled rooms. The roof of thatch,
covered with its thick coating of mud, moss-grown,
tones the scene to one of great picturesqueness,
as seen from the distance.</p>

<p>Toward one of these huts Mrs. Ostrowska
bent her steps this bright, sunny morning in
early January. It was much like all the other
huts in the village, but infinitely gayer. Over
the doors and windows were broad bands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
red and blue and yellow painted with a rude
hand, with dabs of triangles and other geometrical
forms. There were all sorts of attempts
at decoration. Mrs. Ostrowska smiled
as she viewed the fresh colors, and knocked
loudly at the heavy wooden door.</p>

<p>It was opened by an elderly woman, whose
gray hair fell carelessly from its loose coil upon
her head. She was greatly surprised to see
the mistress of the manor, but motioned her
graciously to enter.</p>

<p>"Good morning," Mrs. Ostrowska said, as
she stepped into the smoky atmosphere of the
room, "and how do you find yourself this
morning, Mrs. Gadenz?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, thank you, Madame, except
that the little Henryk is not so well; his
cough is worse."</p>

<p>"I must have the doctor look after him
when he makes his rounds," the mistress answered.
Then she added, "I see by the decorations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
upon your home that Helena is to be
allowed to receive visits from the young men.
Any prospects of a husband yet?"</p>

<p>"No," the woman replied. "Thad put the
colors on just before Christmas, so there hasn't
been much time for the young men to know
that Helena is old enough to have callers.
Now that Emilia is to be married at the Easter
time, we thought it better to get her sister
started."</p>

<p>"She isn't fifteen yet, is she?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the peasant, "but then
there are so many of us we must not keep them
all at home. Some must make way for the
younger ones. <i>I</i> did it, and my daughters must
do so, too."</p>

<p>"You were married very young, were you
not?" Mrs. Ostrowska asked kindly, not meaning
to be inquisitive, but Mrs. Gadenz was a
comparative stranger upon the estate; that is,
she was not born there, as so many of the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
peasants had been; she had come with her
husband and small children from other parts
to find work in the distillery of Mr. Ostrowski.</p>

<p>"At thirteen," the peasant woman replied
proudly.</p>

<p>She was now in her thirty-eighth year, although
she appeared much older; taking up
her wifely burdens at such a tender age, so
common to the peasants of Poland, had made
her seem much older. But despite her faded
cheeks and hair fast turning gray, she was
strong and active, and the fire of the Slav still
shone in her eye.</p>

<p>The three or four younger children, ranging
from ten to three, were playing upon the floor,
tumbling one another about over the cat and
her kittens, and frolicking with the shaggy-coated
dog, who was monopolizing the warmest
corner of the great stove.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, children," the mother spoke
sharply, as she reproved the boisterous youngsters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
"Don't you know that the lady of the
manor is here?"</p>

<p>"Let them play," the lady interposed, "they
get but little of it, at best."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Emilia had left her duty of stirring
the porridge on the great plaster stove
and withdrawn into the only other room. In
a moment she returned, followed by the
younger sister, who approached the mistress of
the dwór and respectfully kissed her hand.</p>

<p>"I wish to be the first to congratulate you,"
the great lady said, "upon being out in the
world now. You are, indeed, growing to be
quite a young lady. Not yet fifteen, and waiting
for a lover. I want you to come up to
the manor Thursday afternoon with Emilia. I
have some sewing for you, and perhaps we
shall be able to fill out that linen chest so that
you may find a most superior husband."</p>

<p>The young girl blushed and thanked her
benefactress kindly, promising to be on hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
promptly. Then she retired to the next room
to finish her tasks there.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you so housewifely," Mrs.
Ostrowska said, as she watched the young
Emilia move about the room, stirring the great
pot of porridge one moment, while in the next
she was tending to the little wants of the
younger ones. "Jan will have need of a good
cook."</p>

<p>Emilia blushed deeply and her face brightened
up; into her soft blue eyes came a look
of tenderness, for was she not thinking of her
own dear one, beloved Jan, to whom she was
to be married at the Easter-tide? And these
latter days she was indeed busy with the
last preparations; there was much left to
do, for she herself was to make the wedding
gown.</p>

<p>"You will be glad to have your own little
home, Emilia?" the lady queried kindly.</p>

<p>"Yes," came the quick reply. "There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
so many of us, and the house is very crowded.
It will be far better when I have a home of
my own."</p>

<p>Emilia set the iron pot on the back of the
stove, where its contents might keep warm
until the visitor had departed, when the children
might then have their midday meal. She
turned to still the whimpering of the little child
in the far corner, stretched upon the straw, the
child with the cough.</p>

<p>"You are nearly ready for the wedding
day?" continued the interlocutor of the young
girl, as the latter stooped to pick up the child
and hold him in her lap.</p>

<p>"Almost. There is yet the wedding gown
to make, besides some small household things
not quite ready. Oh, how I wish the day
would hasten!" she added, with a long-drawn
sigh, drawing the young child's fair head
closer to her breast and pressing a warm, tender
kiss upon the glossy curls.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Ostrowska could understand why. She
regarded the young girl carefully. She knew
that the poor have very few pleasures, that
the older must always care for the younger,
and that young girls crave merriment and company.
With a house full of young children,
the mother away all day in the mills or the
fields, it devolved upon her, the eldest, to manage
the little household, to hush the sobs of
the offended baby, or bind up a hurt finger;
she it was who prepared the meals for the
many mouths, who washed the few necessary
articles of apparel, and the common every-day
round of family cares was distasteful to her
simply because she had no recreations interspersed
among them, for we all know the old
adage, "All work and no play makes Jack a
dull boy." Mrs. Ostrowska understood very
well the wants of her people; it was for this
reason she came among them every day; seeing
an opportunity here to lighten the burden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of one young girl, or helping a talented young
boy to gain instruction in the art or trade that
appealed to him. She was attempting to teach
her peasantry that each one should be given
the chance for which he so longed; and that
he should not be brought up to follow such
and such a calling simply because his father
had followed the same calling from boyhood,
which he, in turn, had followed after his
father.</p>

<p>The elder peasants sometimes resented this
interference in their family affairs, as they
were sometimes wont to call it, in moments of
peevishness, but Mrs. Ostrowska did her good
work quietly and unostentatiously; she helped
the marriageable girls fill their linen chests,
which somewhat ameliorated the feelings of the
elders toward her, for it meant a saving of
much expense to them; she introduced social
etiquette in her sewing circles on Friday mornings;
she taught the valuable science of aiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the sick and injured so that there should be
less illness among the poor; for rather than
spend their hard-earned pence for medical
services they will suffer uncomplainingly. Furthermore,
she was slowly making progress in
instilling into them the need and benefits of
sanitation in their homes.</p>

<p>Every week Mr. Ostrowski made the rounds
of his estate on horseback, to inspect the cottages
which he took such pride in; he argued
with the tenants to compel them to maintain
these homes in cleanliness; for it is a difficult
matter to keep things ship-shape when a dozen
or more often occupy two or three rooms, to
make no mention of the four-footed occupants,
or the feathered tribe.</p>

<p>"I want you to come up to the dwór Thursday
afternoon with Helena," Mrs. Ostrowska
said, after a long silence. "You can begin
your gown then, and you two sisters can work
together."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should love to," the young girl replied,
as her face brightened. She was glad of the
opportunity to get away from the confinement
of the hut and the household duties for a short
time, and this meant an afternoon of extreme
pleasure for her. All the peasant girls loved
to be invited to the manor, for a cup of warm,
delicious tea served with lemon, and pirogi,
those most delectable cakes filled with almond
meal which were such luxuries to them, awaited
them.</p>

<p>"I have a woman coming from Cracow,"
Mrs. Ostrowska continued, as she rose to leave,
"who is bringing some very pretty little trinkets
from the city. I should like to have you
there to make a selection of such as you would
care to have."</p>

<p>"You are more than kind," the girl replied,
in a low voice. "You are always thinking of
our pleasure and happiness."</p>

<p>"That is my duty," the older woman answered;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
"you are all my children, and I must
give you as much happiness as I can, for some
day you will be beyond my care and protection,
and will have no one but your Jan to look after
you."</p>

<p>Again the girl blushed a deep red, and the
tender look returned to her soft eyes at the
mention of her fiancé. She escorted her patroness
to the door of the cottage and closed
it after her. Then she resumed her tasks about
the kitchen, giving the little ones their meal
of barszcz and a slice cut from a cake of cabbage
which had been pressed into a solid
loaf.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ostrowska was glad to be in the clear,
crisp air once more, after the stifling atmosphere
of the cottage, for her peasants were
slow to learn the value of ventilation. As she
continued her way down the road toward the
manor-house, she thought of her "young people,"
as she called them fondly, for she took a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
personal interest in each of them, whether
large or small, girl or boy.</p>

<p>She reviewed their lives, as they live them
from one generation to the other. How they
roll and toss upon the floor of their cabins or
upon the greensward, in unconscious bliss of
childhood. How they attain the age of youth
when they must begin to help share the burdens
of the elders either in the fields or the
mills, if they be boys, or in spinning and caring
for the helpless ones at home, if they be
girls. How they grow up to manhood and
womanhood with very little time for pleasures
and holidays, for all hands must take hold that
the weight may not fall upon one. How finally,
the young girls attain the age of fifteen or
more, when they are allowed to consider the
question of marriage. Then comes to them
courters, and love enters into their lives, to
brighten the eye and redden the cheek. They
live for months and months upon the delights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
they will experience in attending church, the
wedding procession, and the carrying-off of the
bride; then the settling down in their own
nests. After that, they are no longer helpers
in the household, they are the mainstays of
their own homes, and they realize then what
it really means to be home-makers. They take
up their cares and their duties; they arise early,
but then, they have always been used to that;
they must spin and knit, and sew and darn,
and there are no other fingers to help them.
For many years they must do all, until the
little fingers are big enough and strong enough
to aid. Sometimes, they must go out into the
forest and gather fagots for their fires so that
the little one may not suffer from the chill;
they must learn the wonderful art of making
a few pence do duty of many. And year by
year passes; they see their daughters grow up
to that age when they, in turn, must leave their
homes for homes of their own; they see their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
sons going away to the army or to other lands,
perhaps, to seek their fortunes; and thus, from
generation to generation, they continue in this
routine, living in memory, throughout those
days when their lives are filled with busy cares,
that day, so long ago, when they drove to the
village church, the bridal veil falling about
their slender shoulders, the wedding supper and
the gay dance, and the clamor of voices as they
rolled away with their loved ones in the village
cart for the honeymoon. And all the burdens
of their lives, all the toil, all the care and the
endless sameness are more than compensated
for by that one glorious day of their existence&mdash;their
wedding day.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ostrowska planned and planned how
she could educate these peasants in such wise
as to fit them for more than mere care-takers;
that they might learn a little of the refinements
of life, and that, by education, they might
gradually raise themselves to a higher and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
better plane. Her work was slow, but she felt
that already she could see signs of having accomplished
something material of betterment
in their lives.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CARNIVAL SEASON</div>


<p><span class="smcap">January</span> has passed, and February is ushered
in with the Feast of the Candles, or Candlemas
Day, which takes place upon the second
day of the month. This is one of the most
devout religious celebrations in the land, for
the peasants believe, were they to forget this
ceremony even once, that their villages would
be devastated by the wolves which prowl about
over the plains in search of food when the
ground is covered thick with snow, and it is
difficult for them to find sustenance. Long
years before, the villages were not as frequent,
nor as well protected as they now are; therefore,
it did happen that the wild beasts would
descend in droves upon the homes of these
poor people, who were powerless to drive them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
away. Sometimes, these voracious animals
would even carry off the peasants' children before
their very eyes. Consequently, as the
peasants were unable to cope with the enemy,
they must seek assistance somewhere, and where
more naturally than of their patron saint? This
chanced to be the good St. Michael; but even
he was at times without sufficient power to
repel the advances of these beasts. Therefore,
with one accord, the villagers banded together
and made a vow to offer up their prayers to the
Virgin Mother. They pleaded with her, on
bended knees, in the village church, to ward
off this dread enemy and to send them protection.
Whether the prayer was effective or not
is a question. But the story goes that the Holy
Mother seized a lighted candle in her hand,
and holding it in such a manner as to send the
bright flame in the faces of the animals that
preyed at the very borders of the village, so
frightened them that they turned tail and fled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
leaving the peasants in peace and security, for
wild beasts do not take kindly to fire. It was
because they were so miraculously saved from
this dreadful menace that the people thenceforth
celebrated the day each year, which is
known as the Gromnice. And to-day, when
they hear the familiar voices of their tormentor
in the far distance of the woods, they mutter in
their half-waking sleep, "In Thy care, O
Mary," and they leave the rest of the responsibility
to their intercessor.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 348px;">
<img src="images/i099.jpg" width="348" height="500" alt="procession holding long candles" />
<span class="caption">&quot;<span class="smcap">The Procession Formed, the March Begins to
the Church</span>&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Early in the morning of the second of February,
the peasants begin to congregate in the
village square, which is the usual meeting place
on all occasions of public demonstration. Each
one, whether he be an old, bowed man or a tiny
tot just able to stand, holds in his hand a candle,
whose light falls upon his face all lit up
with religious fervor. The procession formed,
the march begins to the church, the oldest leading.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not the custom of European churches
to provide pews for the worshippers; consequently,
unless one is able to afford the luxury
of a low-seated chair upon which to kneel, for
the chairs are never used to sit upon, he must
content himself with kneeling upon the hard,
cold stone floor. It is truly an imposing sight
to see the tall aisle of the church lighted by
the flicker of hundreds of candles, the peasants,
in their vari-colored garments, kneeling devoutly
upon the floor, heads bowed. It is very
real to them, this service for their deliverance
from the fangs of the wolf; and so strong is
their faith that they even place the blessed
candles, after the ceremony is finished, safely
away in some treasured chest or upon their own
private altar, that they may serve them in time
of sickness, trouble or any calamity.</p>

<p>But woe betide the one whose candle blows
out! Evil is certain to follow in his footsteps;
from that moment, he believes himself a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
doomed man. Should it prove to be the candle
of a young girl, perhaps one upon the verge
of her wedding day, it would instantly throw
her into hysterics, for she would know to a
certainty that she will never get a husband.
And what a disgrace she would be in the eyes
of the whole village! A girl without a husband,
an "old maid," as commonly known in
our parlance, would be an unpardonable offence
to the relatives, who would look askance
at her, so strongly is the idea of marriage imparted
to them. It is quite as much of a disgrace
for a woman to remain unmarried, among
the Polish peasantry, as it is for a man to have
no home of his own. When a Polish peasant
dies, he usually leaves behind him a small bit
of ground, upon which stands his cottage with
its tiny garden-space. This is partitioned
equally among the man's children, be they
many or few.</p>

<p>But all men are not fortunate. It sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
happens that illness will rob a man of his
little he has saved during his years of toil, or
careless habits, perhaps, will dwindle his patrimony
to almost nothing, so that when at last
he leaves this world, he has nothing which may
be divided among his children. But the peasants
do not take these matters into consideration
at all. They have one code and they can
see no other way of looking at things. If a
child has been willed no patrimony, then he
must get one of his own, for he is looked
down upon as thoroughly worthless who is
compelled to find lodgings in the home of a
stranger. These men are known as kormorniki,
from the word komora, meaning room.
In Poland a kormorniki has about the same
reputation among his companions as a tramp
has among respectable people in America.</p>

<p>After Candlemas Day comes the Carnival
week, which is the week, as you all know, preceding
Lent. As a final respite before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
forty days of fasting and prayer which will
follow so soon, the people allow themselves all
sorts of liberties and gayeties. Balls are given,
"hunts" are on, and joy reigns supreme, not
only in the city, but in the remote country
places.</p>

<p>Again the manor-house is alive with brilliant
lights and many faces. The owners of adjoining
estates, with their wives and grown-up sons
and daughters, friends of the family, from quite
remote parts even, are gathered together for
one week of holidays. It is a pleasure to see
such wit and beauty gathered together under
one roof; for Polish women are almost all
handsome, with their soft eyes, their beautiful
complexions and their glossy, dark hair. Their
manners are a marvel, and their bearing graceful
and easy. They are capital company and
well informed on all the topics of the day, so
that conversation never lags, nor are they
obliged to fall back upon the inevitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
"cards" for amusement. With them the art
of conversation has not died out, nor the art
of entertaining.</p>

<p>The snow lay thick upon the ground; the
branches of the tall fir trees were clothed in a
heavy coating of whiteness. The sky overhead
was a dull, leaden color; but the guests at the
manor-house were pleased with the wintry conditions,
for it but aided them in the "hunt"
that was "on" that morning.</p>

<p>Breakfast finished, a hearty affair of meat,
cheese and beverages of various sorts, the
sleighs drew up to the portico with boisterous
jangling of sleigh-bells and champing of
horses' bits; the thoroughbred animals pawing
in impatience to be off in the crisp, frosty air.
Gay with red tassels, which swept the front
dash of the heavy sleighs, and joyful with the
chime of the tiny bells, the party drove off to
the neighboring woods, where lay, in unconscious
innocence of their fate, the fleet deer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
The chill of the winter's morning did not affect
the spirits of the party in any degree, for
they were all snugly wrapped in thick fur
robes, and large fur caps completely swathed
their heads, so that nothing visible remained
of them but their vivacious eyes and their ruddy
noses.</p>

<p>Along the broad road the sleighs sped, in
single file, past the peasant village around the
bend of the hill, and off toward the forest
stretching miles ahead of them, the tall tops of
the trees nodding a "good morning" to them
as they approached. Among the firs and oaks
the sleighs were soon lost to sight, winding in
and out among the dark trees until the wagon-road
came abruptly to an end and only a path
stretched in front. It was but the work of a
few moments to clear a considerable circle, and
light the huge bonfire around which every one
gathered, stretching out their half-benumbed
hands. Such a chattering and rumpus! Instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of grown-ups, you might have imagined
them to be a bunch of school-children just out
for recess. But Polish aristocracy understand
how to enjoy themselves under all conditions.</p>

<p>Not long did they tarry about the camp-fire.
It was not for this they had taken the long,
chilly drive. Gathering together their equipment,
and shouldering their guns, off they
tramped through the heavy underbrush; only a
few of the more delicate ladies remained by
the warmth of the cheery flame.</p>

<p>Slowly, slowly they made their way cautiously,
until they came within sight of the
tiny tracks, for the freshly fallen snow was a
sorry telltale for the "game."</p>

<p>Shivering, but happy under their load of
game, the party returned a couple of hours
later, to find everything prepared for the ensuing
meal. The great iron pot hung steaming
over the glowing coals, the aroma of something
therein greeting their nostrils with delight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
For all were famished and in good mood to
enjoy a camp dinner. It seemed but a matter
of a few minutes before the cook and his assistants
had the game ready for the steaming
sauce which awaited it in the iron pot; and
while the company regaled themselves with
jokes and talk of the day's sport, the sauce bubbled
and boiled, but tantalizing the group about
the fire. However, all things come to those
who wait, and it really was not such a great
wait before they were all "falling-to" with
keen appetites. The cuisine was excellent, and
the gamey meat had a relish all its own.</p>

<p>But now the party must hasten home. Too
long have they lingered among the pine trees,
and much longer yet could they tarry, were
there not other arrangements for the evening.
But dinner was awaiting them at the dwór; and
at nine o'clock, as the dining-hall filled with the
gay company, in evening dress, you scarce
would have recognized them as the same persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
who had gathered about the camp-fire
among the pine trees but a few hours previously.</p>

<p>There is always time for everything in Poland,
for the rich. The dinner lengthened itself
out until well toward eleven o'clock. Then
came the "grand ball," for this is Ash Wednesday,
the last day of gayety before the Lenten
season begins.</p>

<p>What a delight it is to watch the Polish men
and women dance! It comes naturally to them,
and I really believe they would much prefer
dancing to any other occupation. While the
manor-folks confine themselves to the more
conventional forms of the dance, down in the
village the peasants dance to the wild mazurkas
and sing weird folk-songs. But in hut or
mansion, there is gayety abroad this last night
of freedom; a short hour, and then, Lent, fasting,
prayer for forty days, observed in most
rigorous manner.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Forty days, nearly six weeks, pass after all,
and before the Lenten days are two-thirds over,
preparations are already begun for the Easter
day. Those indeed are busy times in the culinary
quarters at the dwór. Such heaps and
heaps of food as are prepared in the great
kitchens! Such stacks and stacks of bread as
are baked in the huge ovens, so different from
our own cook-stoves. Gas stoves are unknown
in Poland; all the ovens are brick affairs, such
as are used by bakers, in to which great logs of
heavy wood are placed. And, when the bricks
have been heated to the degree necessary for
the food which is to be cooked, the fire is withdrawn
by long rakes of iron and this heat is
retained for a long enough time to bake.</p>

<p>The Saturday before Easter the table is set
in the long dining-room. This table presents
quite a different appearance from that of the
Christmas table. Now there is every sort of
decoration one could wish for. Hot-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
flowers everywhere; colored Easter eggs, just
as we have, fruit, and sugar lambs. We American
folks can scarce conceive of such lavishness
in articles of food. Not only is there a young
pig served whole upon a gayly decorated platter,
but there are, at intervals the length of the
great table, immense roasts of all kinds; hams
with accompanying sauces, beef, mutton, and
not even the "sweets" are forgotten.</p>

<p>All being in readiness, the village priest enters
and places his blessing upon the food which
graces the groaning board. This is really quite
a serious custom, this blessing of the food, the
houses and everything that pertains to existence.
The peasants are most superstitious in
this, and would no more dare to enter a new
home or even a theatre which had not received
this blessing at the hands of the priest or
bishop, than they would purposely run into
danger.</p>

<p>Easter day itself is quiet. There is the heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
dinner in the early part of the day, when Easter
wishes are bestowed upon one and all, even
the giving of Easter eggs, as we do, not being
omitted.</p>

<p>And now dawns Easter Monday. The religious
ceremonies are finished; the Sabbath
has passed, and on Monday may begin the
merry-making once more. The Polacks are
very fond of life and merriment. They take
advantage of every occasion upon which to
indulge in relaxation from work, and always,
in a quiet way, they get the most out of living
that is possible. Just as we celebrate Hallowe'en
with pranks and games, so the Polacks
celebrate the Smigus on Easter Monday.
Among the peasantry, the jokes are a trifle
rougher than in upper circles, but they are always
good-natured, and never do they allow
themselves to overstep, even in the slightest
degree. The Smigus is, indeed, a merry
romp.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Watch this jaunty little chap as he whistles
gayly on his way to the home of his adored one.
Much courage does it take to venture forth
such a night as this. But when one goes to
visit <i>her</i>, he cares not; he is only too proud to
display his courage, for will not <i>she</i> love him
the better for it? Swish! The whistling is
stopped. A series of muffled sounds, and the
young man regains his equilibrium once again.
He journeys on, but not quite so merrily. His
teeth chatter just a little in his head, and he
walks a trifle quicker. For the water was cold,
and it is not very comfortable to be drenched
unawares. Nevertheless, he feels himself more
or less of a martyr for <i>her</i> sake, and he carries
his head high with self-satisfied pride.</p>

<p>And hark! There is tittering somewhere.
Now we can trace it to the village well. Let
us go and enjoy the sport. My, but what a
screaming! It fairly makes one's ears tingle.
We hasten our steps, for we know there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
girls mixed up in <i>this</i> affair; their shrill, nervous
voices proclaim it upon the still, clear air
of the night. As Helena and her two young
friends from across the road were making their
way to the public well, they, too, were drenched
in exactly the same manner as the young man
had been but a moment before. But, then,
Helena and her friends should have known
better than to venture out upon Easter Monday
evening. Who can say but that they rather
enjoyed the experience? However, they had
their reward, for the young gallants, good-hearted
men if somewhat rough, filled the
pitchers for the maidens and carried them to
the doors of their homes upon their own stout
shoulders. And they all laughed heartily at
the joke. Perhaps, who knows, but that they
might meet their future husbands here?</p>

<p>While the peasants amuse themselves in these
harmless, jolly pranks, the occupants of the
dwór enjoy similar ones, but somewhat differently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
There, the young men are more courtly.
Catching their prey unawares, they shower her
with delicate cologne-water, or twine gayly
colored ribbons about her neck, making her
their captive. And thus, in hut and manor-house,
passes Easter Monday.</p>

<p>But you must not believe that the sports are
all confined to the country-side. Indeed not.
The city folks have their own form of entertainment,
and in the City of Cracow there is
observed a most peculiar custom known as Renkawka
or the Sleeve.</p>

<p>In very olden times, I believe about the year
560 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>, there lived in the south, among the
Carpathian Mountains, a very unimportant
chief named Krakus. He was a good man, a
most unusual thing in that age; therefore everybody
loved him, and that was a great honor,
because the times were warlike and people
cared more for a chief who showed himself
brave but fierce than they did about one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
was gentle and kind. It so happened that
Krakus made a journey to the north. He came
to a fine hill, about whose foot ran a broad,
clear river called the Vistula. As he was looking
for a site upon which to build himself a
fortress, he decided this was just the very place
for his. But he found it one thing to wish and
quite another thing to obtain. The hill was
guarded by a fierce dragon who kept watch,
day and night, that no one might take it away.
However, Krakus was a brave man, and he
longed so intensely for the hill, especially now
that he knew he ought not to have it, that he
decided to fight the dreadful dragon. Therefore,
he took his trusty sword and shield,
mounted the hill, fought the monster and conquered
it. Had he not done so, there would
have been no story. He then set to work to
build his castle upon the very top of that impregnable
hill, with the beautiful river running
around its base. He called the fortress-castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the Wawel, because that was the name of the
hill upon which it stood.</p>

<p>This castle of Krakus still is standing, but
it is in a sad state of ruin. However, the Russian
government, to whom it now belongs, is
putting it in repair, so that it may present the
same appearance of grandeur and splendor that
it did in the days of good King Krakus.</p>

<p>You all know what a castle is; but perhaps
there are few of you who understand what it
means when applied to an ancient stronghold.
The Wawel castle really included quite a small
village inside its massive walls, for here the
chief or king, with his retainers and his army,
were wont to lock themselves safely in at close
of day, that the enemy, who was always lurking
in wait in those times, could do them no harm.
It is here, to this Wawel, that Mrs. Ostrowska
had promised to take the children in the June
time, upon St. John's Eve, to witness the ceremony
of the Wianki.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, when King Krakus died, his people
mourned him exceedingly. They erected a
huge mound outside the city on the further side
of the river in his honor. The peasants wore
a sort of tunic, at that time, with very wide
sleeves, much like the sleeves worn by Japanese
women. It was in these convenient sleeves they
carried the earth with which to erect the mound,
hence the ceremony takes its name Renkawka
or Sleeve.</p>

<p>It is a peculiarity of the Polish peasant that,
once a custom is established, it is never abandoned,
even though the necessity has long
since passed away. I doubt very much if any
of those who participate in the Renkawka could
tell you why the custom is observed; nevertheless
each Easter Monday they gather about the
mound, dressed in these old-fashioned garments
with wide sleeves. They no longer carry
earth with them, as in the old days, however;
they bring nothing, but they return with full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
sleeves, for it has developed into a custom for
the rich to send the food which has been left
from the Easter feast, that it might be distributed
among the needy.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE VILLAGE WEDDING</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> few days after Easter, while the children
at the dwór were reading to their mother
in the library, the clatter of hoofs was heard
upon the hard road without. Marya jumped
up from her chair and ran, with fleet steps, to
the front window overlooking the entrance-porch.
Such a clatter and racket as there was!
One would almost imagine himself back in
the days of post-horses and outriders. There,
under cover of the carriage entrance, were four
gayly dressed young peasants, proudly seated
upon slick horses, who were stamping their feet
and neighing most strenuously.</p>

<p>"Mother," cried Marya excitedly, "see
what's here! Quick!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Ostrowska smiled, but did not hasten,
for she well knew the meaning of this hubbub.
This was the formal invitation to the krakowich,
the wedding of Emilia. She approached
the French window and stepped out upon the
wide veranda, and she smiled a welcome to the
druzbowie, who had come to extend their best
wishes from the bride and the groom, and all
their relatives, to the mistress and master of
the manor, together with their family and their
guests, and to request their presence at the
wedding of the fair Emilia at the village
church at noon.</p>

<p>After Mrs. Ostrowska assured the best men
of their acceptance and that they all would be
most pleased to accept the kind invitation, the
four young men rode gayly down the sloping
driveway and disappeared at the bend of the
road, their gorgeous feathers flowing free in
the breeze. And only the clatter of their
horses' feet were heard in the distance.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>In great state, the family coach drew up to
the entrance-porch some time later and the
Ostrowski family drove off toward the home
of the bride. It seemed as though the entire
populace had turned out for the occasion.
Such a crowd as there was gathered before
the tiny home! And such colors! And yet
more people pouring out of the one small door
of the humble cottage. One would scarce believe
it possible for so small a space to hold
so many persons! But no one asks or wishes
much room upon such a festal occasion as this;
and there was nothing but smiling faces, bright
eyes, and gay colors to be seen.</p>

<p>One wondered, too, where the simple peasant
girls could have obtained such gorgeous raiment.
There were black velvet gowns, all
tight-fitting, with short sleeves, and ankle
length. Some were exquisitely embroidered in
gold or silver thread, others in bright silks,
or even in colored cotton thread. But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
was every conceivable hue and shade. If they
have nothing else, these peasant maidens will
have a holiday attire of the most gorgeous,
and they take delight and pride in saving up
for years in order to make their own costumes
more beautiful than their neighbors'. Over
their dark, glossy hair a brilliant handkerchief
is knotted, one in one manner, one in another,
but all of them picturesque. It would seem impossible
for the Polish peasant to be other than
charming in her holiday dress.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/i125.jpg" width="337" height="500" alt="Bride in cart; crowd gathered" />
<span class="caption">&quot;<span class="smcap">She was Bundled into the Village Cart</span>&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Some of the more fortunate ones wore long
pendants from their brown ears, while yet others
had on long strings of beads, some of coral,
others of pearls, or yet of a bluish stone resembling
turquoise. Every bit of finery, some
handed down from one generation to another,
priceless treasures, was in evidence upon this
occasion, and even the young men were scarce
outdone in their velvet jackets and gay sashes.</p>

<p>The occupants of the carriage from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
manor-house saluted the assembled peasants
warmly, who returned their salute. Marya
looked in vain for the young bride; she was
nowhere to be seen. But Helena, the younger
sister, approached and offered the master and
mistress a drink in which to toast her sister.</p>

<p>At length Marya spied her; she was just
issuing forth from the cottage-door. Her
white veil fell over her young shoulder with
grace as she made her way slowly to the carriage
in order to receive the blessing of her
master and mistress. Suddenly, kneeling in
respect, the bride was seized by several burly
men in gala attire. With a scream of terror,
and amid copious tears, all of which were part
of the programme, she was bundled into the
village cart and the procession moved onwards,
headed by two of the best men, while the other
two druzbowie brought up the rear to escort
the bridal couple to the church. This is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of the pretty customs left of the old days when
the grooms were in the habit of virtually and
truly stealing away their brides before the very
eyes of their fond parents, often without the
consent of the young lady herself. It is a harmless
practice at this day, and a pretty one, affording
much pleasure to the bride, and much
satisfaction to the groom. Besides, the peasants
would scarce believe themselves properly
married unless this ceremony prevailed.</p>

<p>The longest part of a wedding is not at the
church; the service lasted but a very short
time when every one wended his way back to
the home of the bride once again. During
their absence the tables had been laid for the
wedding supper, supplied by the generosity of
the master of the dwór, and then having drank
a last health to the young couple, the rooms
were cleared for the wedding dance.</p>

<p>The village had not seen such a wedding for
many years as Emilia had. She was a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
favorite, with her quiet manners, her soft voice
and her kind ways to all.</p>

<p>After the grand march, led by the bride, who
leaned upon the arm of Mr. Ostrowski himself,
followed by the groom with Mrs. Ostrowska,
the master and mistress withdrew from the
scene, leaving the peasants to enjoy the dancing
and gayety to their hearts' content without the
consequent restraint of their presence.</p>

<p>Now, indeed, did the stout old walls of the
plastered hut ring with merriment! The beams
fairly shook under the heavy tread of so many
husky feet, and it was not until a late hour of
the afternoon that the bride and her husband
were able to make their escape.</p>

<p>Until every ceremony has been gone through
with, the young Polish peasant bride may not
free herself from the attentions of the four
best men, who take it upon themselves to act
as a sort of body-guard and chaperones. Therefore,
under their protection, the newly-weds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
repaired to the top of the hill for their final
blessing, as well, no doubt, as a substantial
wedding gift.</p>

<p>The day for them was about finished. The
visit to the village photographer was the end;
here they were photographed in all the finery
of their wedding dress, the one leaning lovingly
upon the arm of the other; and what a comfort
it will be to them, in the years that are
to come, when trials and tribulations come to
them, to look upon the picture of themselves
as they were upon that delightful day of their
wedding, young, care-free and happy.</p>

<p>And thus the wedding day of Emilia drew
to a close.</p>

<p>There was one very amusing incident which
occurred at the wedding, but not at all out of
the ordinary among the Polish peasantry.
Necessarily, being poor, they economize in
those things which are not absolute necessities;
and shoes being one of these, they are in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
habit of going barefoot. But they always possess
one pair of best shoes, usually with very
high French heels, of which they are inordinately
proud. It would amount almost to sacrilege
for them to wear these creations on any
but the grandest and most important occasions.
It would be a pity to scuff them out upon the
dusty, rocky roads; so, as the women made
their way to the church, they carried their
shoes and put them on at the entrance of the
church. I really believe they did this more
because they would be unable to walk in such
high-heeled affairs, for it is somewhat of an
art to manage one's feet properly, even at best.
As soon as the occasion was over, the shoes
were laid carefully aside for use upon another
gala day. In this way, one pair of shoes will
last a life-time, and no doubt many of them
descend to the younger members of the family,
as the older ones outgrow them.</p>

<p>And now the weeks are speeding by, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Corpus Christi Day has come, a religious festival
which takes place about eight weeks after
Easter. It is a national holiday, and in the
city of Cracow the procession Bozé Cialo takes
place. Here, in the rynek, or public square,
gather the entire population of the city, from
the oldest infirm inhabitant to the youngest
toddler each with his candle in his hand. The
bishop of the church conducts the ceremony
of the day with great solemnity; and the procession
marches around the great square with
banners and images of the Christ, while little
flower girls, crowned with white flowers, scatter
rose-petals from the dainty baskets hung
from their shoulders. The soldiers, with their
bright uniforms and their gay helmets, mingle
with the worshippers, and all is bustle, light
and solemnity. After the ceremony, however,
the crowds disperse to make merry during the
remainder of the day; for in Europe, upon
fast days, after the religious services are ended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the people are at liberty to enjoy themselves as
they best care to.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Spring has truly arrived; the leaves are budding
forth now in all their new greenness. The
spring flowers are shooting forth from their
winter shelter and the sun shines warmly, but
the air is yet a trifle crisp.</p>

<p>There has been a general house-cleaning
during the past few days among the Polish
peasantry, just as we have a general house-cleaning
time, so much dreaded by our fathers.
The huts in the villages have been freshly
whitewashed; some, even, have been tinted
blue to vary the monotony. About the doors
and windows are bound great boughs of green,
for the Spring Festival has come, and the peasants
have been taught to be ever grateful to,
and appreciative of, the goodness of their
Father, for all the benefits they have received,
and for another springtime; believing that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
upon the quantity of boughs and leaves with
which they decorate their homes, will depend
the fruitfulness of the coming crops. And thus,
with great joy, is spring welcomed in Poland.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE ORPHANAGE IN THE WOODS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the spring season advanced, the two children
at the dwór grew more and more excited.
They were awaiting, with great impatience,
the arrival of St. John's Eve, the 24th
of June.</p>

<p>Marya was seated upon the stiff-looking sofa
in the reception salon, while her brother Peter
was looking through a book of photographs,
depicting the celebration of the Wianki.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose mother will allow us to
cast a wreath into the Vistula?" asked Peter,
without looking up from his book, so intensely
wrapped up was he in the illustrations.</p>

<p>"Certainly," Marya replied. "If we go to
the celebration at all, we will be allowed to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
as the others do. I shall ask her," Marya continued,
"for it wouldn't be a bit of fun to go
all the way to Cracow just to watch the others;
I want some of the fun for myself."</p>

<p>"You don't imagine you will be allowed to
go in search of the wonderful fern, do you,
Marya?" the boy questioned.</p>

<p>"Why not? Of course I know I may not
go alone, but I shall have Mademoiselle with
me. It would be quite proper then, and Mademoiselle
would enjoy it herself, I am sure. She
has never seen the celebration, Peter, and she's
just as crazy over it as we are. If sister Martha
comes we will be allowed to go," the girl
continued, "for she knows what it is to be
shut off from every pleasure that even the commonest
people have."</p>

<p>"Marya," warned Peter, in a low tone.</p>

<p>At the warning, the girl looked up. She saw
her mother upon the threshold. She arose instantly
from her seat upon the sofa and advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
toward her mother, saluting her with
a kiss upon the cheek. Her brother did likewise,
and together they gently led her toward
the sofa and seated her, drawing up two chairs
for themselves, so as to face her. But Marya
did not seat herself by the side of her mother.
It is a curious custom throughout Europe that
the sofa is the seat of honor, to be occupied
by the person highest in rank, and, while one
may occupy a sofa when alone in the room, it
is considered the height of impoliteness to seat
one's self upon that sacred article of furniture
when one of superior rank, or an elder, is in
the room; therefore it was for this reason that
the children placed their mother upon the sofa
while they occupied chairs by her side.</p>

<p>"Now, children, listen," Mrs. Ostrowska
said, as she gathered her two children to her.
"You need not be a bit afraid that you will
not enjoy yourselves in Cracow. I have promised
to take you to the celebration of the Wianki,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and you have looked forward to it for a
long time with great expectation. You shall
not be disappointed. We will forget everything
for that night, and you may enter into
all the sports of the people, if you choose.
Even Marya, dear, if she wishes, may penetrate
into the depths of the forest and search for the
sacred fern which may blossom for her alone
this year. Perhaps you may be the fortunate
one to find it, Marya. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"I hope I shall," the girl replied. "But
suppose Mademoiselle should become frightened
and want to return?"</p>

<p>"In that event," the mother said, smiling,
"so long as you have the courage, you may
continue alone," for she felt quite safe in granting
this privilege, as she did not truly believe
her little daughter would be brave enough to
continue alone.</p>

<p>"When shall we start?" Marya asked, in
great excitement.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is now the twentieth of June," Mrs. Ostrowska
replied. "Your father has some business
to attend to in Cracow, so we shall leave
here on the twenty-second, which will give us
ample time to look about the city and have a
good visit with your sister Martha, for you
know she promised to meet us there."</p>

<p>"So did sister Gabriele," added Peter.</p>

<p>"Yes," the mother replied, "we shall all be
together, I hope."</p>

<p>"And may I go now and tell Mademoiselle?"
Marya inquired, eagerly, as she
rose.</p>

<p>"Run along," the mother answered. "And
what was my boy reading as I came in?" she
continued, turning to her son, who had not had
a chance to say much while the irrepressible
sister was in the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, I was looking at some old books I
found in the library, about the celebration of
the Wianki. I wanted to know all about it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
there are some wonderful pictures of it
too."</p>

<p>"It is a curious custom, no doubt," the
mother replied, as she walked to the table, where
the book still remained open. And, for some
time, the two looked over the great volume of
illustrations, remarking every little while about
this one or that.</p>

<p>"You remember the story of the Princess
Wanda, and how she threw herself into the
Vistula in order to save her country from
wars?" the mother asked.</p>

<p>"Very well, indeed," the boy replied. "She
was a brave princess. But is it really true,
mother?" the boy inquired.</p>

<p>"There <i>was</i> a Princess Wanda at one time,
but as to the rest of the story, that is what
people say about her."</p>

<p>At this moment Marya re-entered the room,
leading her governess by the hand.</p>

<p>"Mother," the child said, as she advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
toward the table where the mother and son
were engrossed in their book, "Mademoiselle
is as delighted as I am, with the prospect of
seeing the celebration, aren't you, Mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I am," the young lady replied. "I
have read much about it, in France, but have
never witnessed one of the festivals; besides,
it happens to be my birthday, so it will be an
added pleasure."</p>

<p>"I have arranged for the children of the Orphanage
to come out to us just after our
return," Mrs. Ostrowska said, addressing the
tall, bright-eyed young lady who served in capacity
of governess to her daughter; "I wish
you would take Marya down to the Bosquet
and help prepare the cottage for their reception.
The maids are there now, airing the place
out, and I will drive over later in the afternoon,
when I shall have everything together that I
want sent down."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well, Madame," Mademoiselle replied.
"Marya and I will attend to it as soon
as luncheon is finished. Shall we take the pony
cart?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you might," Mrs. Ostrowska said,
"and, when you arrive there, see that the beds
are well aired, for the maids are apt to be a little
careless, and we can't afford to have any of the
children take cold."</p>

<p>"There's luncheon now," Marya called out,
impulsively.</p>

<p>"Run along then, children," the mistress
said, "and remember, day after to-morrow we
are off for Cracow."</p>

<p>With hurried steps the two children left the
room, followed by Mademoiselle, while Mrs.
Ostrowska busied herself about her domestic
arrangements, for she never entrusted these
duties to any one.</p>

<p>After luncheon Marya and Mademoiselle
drove off in the pony cart, through the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
gardens, which were blossoming with all
sorts of magnificent flowers, past the great fish-ponds
at the rear, and on through the thick
woods. Finally they pulled rein at a most picturesque
maisonette, or cottage, situated in the
very heart of the forest. It was built of logs;
a wide veranda ran across the entire front. The
house was large enough to accommodate one
hundred girls with their chaperones. Inside
everything was as comfortable as could be.
There was a general sitting-room where the
orphaned girls could gather in the evening and
listen to the folk-tales their hostess or her substitutes
would tell. There were great dormitories,
with twenty or thirty snowy, white beds
arranged in rows against the walls, with large
airy windows between. There was the dining-room,
with its long table spread with good,
substantial food; and how the walls did ring
with the laughter and joyousness of these little
orphaned children from the city, who were invited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
each year to spend two weeks or more
as the guests of the benevolent proprietor's
wife, Mrs. Ostrowska. And all over the
country of Poland this is the custom for
the wives of the landed proprietors to do.
They give of their wealth for the betterment
of the poor and to ease their burden a
little.</p>

<p>Each morning a group of girls, selected by
the mistress in charge, tramp off through the
woods, baskets on arms, to receive from the
kitchen of the dwór the supplies for the following
day; and you may be sure this is no
small matter, to fill fifty or one hundred hungry
mouths. In the afternoons, after the day's
work is finished, for these girls do all their own
housekeeping in the maisonette, they gather
berries or wood-flowers, which they present to
their kind hostess, a delicate thoughtfulness
which she fully appreciates, for these poor little
orphaned ones have no other way in which to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
express their gratitude for the pleasures they
accept.</p>

<p>Everything being in readiness, Marya and
her governess returned home through the
woods, driving leisurely so as to enjoy the fresh
odor of the firs. It was quite late when they
reached the dwór; tea was being served on the
veranda. Here they sought out Mrs. Ostrowska
and reported their progress. Then Marya
was whisked off by Mademoiselle to attend to
her practising.</p>

<p>The morning of the twenty-second dawned
bright and warm. Immediately after breakfast,
the great carriage pulled up at the porch,
and all were soon installed within. The whips
were cracked, and away the horses sped down
the wide avenue of linden trees, through the
great stone brama and out into the country
road. They had not gone very far when the
animals were reined in most emphatically, for
the highway had become a horrible mass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
mud and ruts. The public roads of Poland are
proverbial for their wretchedness. The carriage
swayed from side to side as it lurched
from one deep rut into another; and had it
not been for the splendid springs of the carriage,
it would have been much more comfortable
to have walked. You may imagine what
it would mean to jolt over these same roads in
a britschka, or public cart, which is so widely
in use in Poland. It is a sort of open carriage,
without springs of any kind, with a hood which
can either be raised or lowered, at the will of
the occupant. I fear a ride in such a contrivance
would not be very enjoyable. However,
in spite of the ill condition of the road, Cracow
was reached safely late in the afternoon. Upon
reaching the hotel where accommodations had
been reserved, they found the two sisters awaiting
them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ostrowska had found the journey very
fatiguing, consequently she did not care to dress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and descend for dinner; dinner, therefore, was
served upstairs in her private sitting-room, and
the family spent the remainder of the evening
in discussing their plans for the morrow, and
in visiting.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE BROTHERS DISAGREED</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is market-day in Cracow; but then it is
always market-day in Cracow, so that would
be nothing extraordinary. The rynek, or
square, is crowded with groups of peasants,
some sitting on stools beside their vegetables
exposed for sale; others sheltered under huge
umbrellas, knitting stockings for their family,
while awaiting customers. Here are displayed
laces, vegetables, also chickens and ducks, alive
and squawking. There is scarcely anything one
would have need of that is not displayed in this
square. Indeed, it is a lively spot and a beautiful
sight.</p>

<p>We have some hours to pass before evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
comes, when we may ascend to the Wawel for
the celebration; therefore, we shall look about
us in this active part of the city and see some
of the interesting sights and ancient buildings,
for most cities are interesting only as they can
present some historical reference. Here is an
ancient-looking castle at this side of the rynek;
indeed, it not only looks ancient, but it <i>is</i> ancient.
Like everything else in Poland, it has
a queer-sounding name to us; it is known as
Pod Baranami, which means Under the Ram's
Head, from its heraldic sign over the front.
This is the home of the Potockis, one of the
very ancient families of the country. So prominent
is this castle in the history of Poland that
the Emperor has chosen it as his residence when
he is in the city of Cracow. But it would be
quite improper for the Emperor to accept quarters
in the home of another; he must be the
veritable head of the house; therefore it happens
that, from an old custom, it is usual for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the family to move to other quarters and to
permit the sovereign full possession. The Emperor,
however, is not without graciousness.
He accepts the generosity of his subject, and
atones for the inconvenience he has been put
to by inviting the owner and his family to dine
with him. It must seem very strange to be
invited to dinner in one's own home with another
at the head.</p>

<p>And here, a little further along, is the most
interesting building known as the Sukiennice,
nothing more nor less than the Cloth Hall. In
early days, when there were no great department
stores and selling agents for goods, the
makers of cloth formed a guild or club, which
became known throughout the land as the Cloth
Guild. They built a great hall in which to display
their goods, for there were no shops in
those times, as there are now. This building
became known as the Cloth Hall. Here the
Guild met to discuss the prices they should ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
for the finished material, and how much they
ought to pay for the raw. The Cloth Guild
was one of the richest and most influential of
all the Guilds, for people were extravagant in
their dress and wore most exquisite materials.</p>

<p>The Sukiennice is a great building of stone
with the stairway to the second story running
up on the outside of the building; there are
queer little turrets, one at each corner, and
heavy arcades upon the ground floor, which
protect the passers-by from the elements, as
well as assist in rendering the interior very
dark.</p>

<p>Here, in the city of Cracow, the peasants will
tell you of a curious belief among them. The
founder of Poland was Lekh, as you all have
read. He was supposed to have come from the
far south, when quite a grown man; but there
are always two sides to every story, as the saying
is. And no two historians can agree as to
which version is really the correct one concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Lekh. The peasants here believe that Lekh
was born in this very city, and they absolutely
refuse to believe anything else. In any event,
the story goes that when he was a very young
baby, as he was lying in his cradle one day,
without any one near, a fierce dragon with
three heads tried to devour him; but no harm
came to the child, for he grew up safely to
manhood. Perhaps his faithful nurse returned
in time to avert the threatened danger. However,
many, many years later, in this same city
of Cracow, in the year 1846, the country of
Poland suffered its greatest humiliation, for
Cracow was the very last city in the country to
fall into the hands of the enemy. And now
once more comes the dragon with the three
heads; it is the enemy, Austria, Germany and
Russia, who joined their forces together to tear
beloved Poland into pieces, and this time it won
the victory.</p>

<p>The people of Poland will tell you that once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
upon a time, in the early days of the country's
history, there was a certain king reigning over
the land, who was very good and wise. He
saw that his beloved people and the land in
which they lived was not what it should be;
that something was wrong. Being a solicitous
father for his country, he left no stone unturned
to discover some remedy for the malady which
ailed Poland. Physicians, famed throughout
the land, were sent for and consultations held,
but all in vain. There seemed no cure for the
patient. However, there was yet one resource
left. In the land was a woman who was very
clever at divinations; to her, in his last extremity,
the good, kind king went and stated
his trouble.</p>

<p>"Fear not," the prophetess answered, after
listening to the king's tale, "I will endeavor to
aid you."</p>

<p>The king was delighted at her encouraging
words, but he felt somewhat doubtful of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
result, as so many had failed before her. The
old woman selected three brothers from out the
land; to each of them she gave a third part
of a flute.</p>

<p>"You are to journey together," she said to
them, "until you have crossed over seven mountains,
and crossed seven flowing rivers. When
you reach a certain peak in the Carpathian
Mountains to the southwest of Poland, you are
to halt, put the pieces of the flute together, and
blow upon it. At the sound, your brave old
king, Boleslaw, and his valiant knights, will
arise from their sleep of death, take up their
weapons, and conquer your enemy, when Poland
will once more be restored to her former
state of splendor and glory."</p>

<p>The king thanked the prophetess kindly, adding
a most substantial gift for her services.
He saw the three brothers set off upon their
task of salvation for the country.</p>

<p>The three young men journeyed together, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
they had been bid, until they crossed seven
running rivers and had climbed over seven
mountains. At length they reached the Carpathian
Mountains as the old woman had told
them. Upon the top of the peak she had named
they halted, and pieced the flute together. Then
arose the important question of which they had
not thought before: <i>who</i> should blow upon
the flute.</p>

<p>The oldest brother thought he should, for
was he not the eldest? The second brother
thought he had just as much right to blow upon
the flute as his older brother. Why should he
have all the glory when they, too, had made
the long journey as well as the eldest? But
the youngest brother was not content with this
arrangement. He felt that he should have a
turn at the flute as well as the other two. And,
in this manner, they bickered and bickered.
The days sped by without the question being
settled. And thus it remained. As they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
not agree as to which one should blow upon the
flute, no one blew upon it. King Boleslaw did
not awaken from his sleep. His knights, in
their suits of armor, remained by his side, tranquil
and at rest, and Poland, poor Poland, the
ill one, was left to its fate. The legend runs,
that the names of the three brothers were Aristocracy,
Bourgeoisie and Peasantry. And to-day,
were they given another opportunity to
show their worth, there would be no question
as to which one of the three would blow upon
the flute, for all Poland has agreed that its
hope and life are due to the youngest brother,
Peasantry. And in this hope the upper class
Polacks are bending every effort towards improving
the condition and education of the common
people, for thereby they believe the day
will come when the peasantry will arise, like
the knights of King Boleslaw, and fight for
their liberty. The inference is that the peasants
are now asleep; they do not see their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
opportunities, nor know their strength; but
that when they do arise they will bring peace
and prosperity once more to dear Poland.</p>

<p>Peter and Marya were so interested in the
history of the city, and in looking at its magnificent
old buildings, they were not aware how
rapidly the time was passing, until their mother
told them it was time to return to the hotel for
dinner. As soon as the first rays of dusk crept
on, they insisted upon making their way to the
Wawel, so as not to miss anything; for well
they knew, these little children of the aristocracy,
they would not be again permitted this
privilege. As they drove from the hotel to the
top of the hill they passed great crowds, and
yet more and more, all making their way on
foot up the toilsome incline to the castle, the
one spot of activity that night.</p>

<p>A bright fire was already burning within the
fortress courtyard. The flames leaped higher
and higher until they fairly seemed to reach to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the vaulted blue above. About the fire were
gathered thousands and thousands of people:
old men and women, young men and their wives
and sweethearts, for the entire populace had
turned out to celebrate the Wianki, or wreaths.
Each one bore in his hand a wreath of flowers
or leaves, all of different colors; and while the
band played entrancing music, wild polonaises
and mazurkas, the people cast their wreaths
into the waters of the Vistula. Brilliant fireworks
of every description lighted up the
scene, making the sky one mass of light and
color. Every one looked very happy and gave
himself up to the joy of the moment.</p>

<p>The wreaths having been cast into the river,
the young folks joined hands in a great circle
about the blazing fire. They danced round and
round, singing Polish airs; strangers all they
were, but enjoying each other's company. From
among the circle, two young folks were chosen,
a man and a young girl, the circle of singers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
coupling the names of the two together, prophesying
that these two might become affianced
and wed happily. What mattered it that they
were unknown to each other? What mattered
anything that night, when all hearts were light,
and youth was abroad?</p>

<p>In games and sports of this character, the
evening wore away and the hour of midnight
approached. Marya was becoming more and
more excited. She grasped the hand of Mademoiselle
tighter, for fear she should lose her;
then she might not penetrate into the forest.</p>

<p>One by one the young girls of the group
slipped away and disappeared into the gloom
of the surrounding woods; Marya believed it
was about time that she, too, were making good
her escape. Holding tightly to the hand of
her governess, she walked slowly in the direction
the others had taken. She had at last set
out on her search for the magic fern which
grows in the forest. She would try to discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
its hiding-place; for she longed for a happy and
successful life. It is no small task, this, that
Marya had set for herself. In the first place
the fern is magic; it is not to be seen by every
one; it blooms just a second, exactly as the midnight
hour strikes, and then is gone. And another
full year must roll by before the maiden
may search a second time.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/i161.jpg" width="346" height="500" alt="Girl in woods" />
<span class="caption">&quot;<span class="smcap">Her Heart was Beating Faster and Faster</span>&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"I shall find it," Marya kept repeating to
herself, over and over again. But she knew
she could not hope to do so if she persisted in
holding fast to the hand of Mademoiselle. No
one must have an escort who would find the
precious flower. But Marya was timid. Never
before had she been permitted out after dark,
even alone with her governess. The woods
were very dark. The moon shone through the
leaves, 'tis true, but the beams only added to
the fright of the young girl, for they cast weird
shadows upon the tree-trunks and more than
once she was for turning back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>She dared not call out for fear of breaking
the magic spell, and she did so want to find the
magic fern.</p>

<p>Her heart was beating faster and faster; she
groped her way through the thick trees, keeping
her eyes riveted upon the ground in search
of the prize. Suddenly she saw a bright light
ahead of her. She wondered what it could be;
whether it was some sprite's home in the forest,
and what was going to happen to her next.
Then she heard the tinkle of a bell. "The
hejnal," she told herself. "Midnight." She
counted the strokes one by one. So intent was
she upon her task that she forgot the magic
fern. She forgot Mademoiselle. She forgot
everything but the musical tones of the church
bell tolling the midnight hour. She kept her
course toward the light in the distance. When
she approached it, she found herself once more
on the Wawel hill, by the side of the great fire
about which she had danced so happily the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
part of the evening. She had been walking in
a circle; and there, not ten feet from her, was
Mademoiselle; but neither of them had discovered
the magic fern.</p>

<p>"Well, it was fun anyway," Marya said,
when twitted by her brother for her failure.
"And I am sure if I could try again, I would
walk in a straight line next time."</p>

<p>The party returned to the hotel; the festival
was ended, and on the morrow the Ostrowski
family returned to their dwór beyond Cracow.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE HARVEST FESTIVAL</div>


<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now our vacation is about ended. The
year is drawing to a close. Harvest time has
arrived; the crops are stacked up in the fields
to be garnered in.</p>

<p>The peasants have finished their year's work
out-of-doors. They have served their master's
interests well; all that remains is his inspection
to see that all is satisfactory, and his approval
that they earned their wages.</p>

<p>Mr. Ostrowski, accompanied by his good
wife, left their home upon the hill and walked
towards the great fields of yellow grain. It
was not permitted the peasant to garner in these
sheaves until the master had passed by. Suddenly,
they were seized from behind. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
were seized gently but forcibly. While one
young man held the wrists of the mistress, and
others the wrists of the master, other peasants
picked up strands of the golden straw and assisted
in securely binding their captives. The
master and mistress pleaded for their liberty,
but their captors were adamant. No ransom, no
liberty. At length, after promises of ransom,
the peasants unbound their victims, the money
was paid over, and the master and mistress
were free. Laughing, they passed on their
way across the field, while the merry peasants
then began to stack the golden grain upon their
carts and haul it away to the barns.</p>

<p>It is a very pretty custom, this one of the
Harvest Festival; and master and laborer enter
into the spirit of it with keen zest. It but
endears their patron to them the more that he
permits this privilege; the ransom is not more
than a few pennies; but the master must pay
it before he may regain his liberty. All over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the estate, from one field to the other, the same
ceremony is indulged in for the harvest crops.</p>

<p>What merry-making there is in the village
during the rest of the day and all through the
evening, after the crops are safely stowed away
for the winter!</p>

<p>The fairest maiden of the village is the queen
of the day. She wears her white dress with a
queenly air, too; and holds her proud head
high, crowned with flowers. Forming in line,
the queen at the head, the bridesmaids following,
and then the other villagers in the order
of their importance, the gay procession marches
slowly up the hill, singing folk songs as they
mount. Their sweet, musical voices announce
their arrival long beforehand to the mistress of
the dwór. She meets them at the porch with
graciousness. The queen kneels for her mistress'
blessing, and once more they return down
the hill toward the village, but now they are
enriched with a quantity of small money, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
which they straightway proceed to set up a supper,
after which they dance the rest of the hours
away. They have good cause to be light-hearted,
for they know their work is finished
for the season, and there are full barns for the
winter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And we have now spent a full year in the
delightful, quaint land of Lekh; dear Poland,
from whose brow has never vanished the one
cloud that mars it. It has learned its tragic
lesson too late, that what it does not sow it may
not reap. The nobles had been too much enwrapped
in their own gayety, in their exclusiveness,
to turn their hands to the task of setting
things straight. The bourgeoisie were
neither of one class nor another; they could not
afford to compromise themselves by turning
either way, consequently they turned neither,
and were useless as aids. The peasants were
raised in ignorance, were overburdened and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
kept constantly under the leash, so to speak,
and while their strength might have saved the
country, they had not the brain-power to solve
a means therefor. So that neither of the three
brothers being able to decide which should
blow upon the flute, as neither class would take
upon itself to save the land, so they now await
the decision. In the meantime, Poland belongs
to the three conquering nations, the Russians,
the Austrians and the Germans, neither of
which the Polacks are devoted to.</p>

<p>And yet, with all its indecision, Poland has
given the world some glorious men and women.
Copernicus, the world-famed astrologer, was
born in the city of Thorn upon the River Vistula,
on February 19, 1473. Chopin, the great
musical composer, was the son of a Polish
woman, although he is buried in France. Marcella
Sembrich, Edouard De Reszke and his
brother Jean, of grand opera fame, Helena
Modjeska, our beloved actress, now passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
away, and Jan Paderewski, the celebrated pianist,
are all Polacks. And we Americans have
much to be indebted for to a great Polish soldier.
You may not even know his name; had
it not been for Tadeusz Kosciuszko, I doubt
very much whether Washington, our dearly
beloved George Washington, would have
proven so successful in his endeavors for independence.</p>

<p>It is a long way from Warsaw in Poland to
the American colonies; especially was it so in
the year 1776, when transportation was not
what it now is. But Tadeusz did not consider
distance or hardship. He was willing to go
anywhere, so long as it would take him from
the place where he had suffered so keenly. For
back in Poland, Tadeusz loved a beautiful girl.
The father of this young lady did not approve
of Kosciuszko as a lover. He feared the two
might elope, which they had really planned to
do. Therefore, he carried off his daughter in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the dead of night, so that Tadeusz never saw
her again.</p>

<p>Kosciuszko roamed first here and then there
in his sorrow; he did not care much where he
went to. At last he went to Paris. All the
modern world was talking about the courage
of the American colonists in taking up their
struggle against the mother country. And it
happened that during his stay in Paris, Kosciuszko
chanced to meet our minister, Benjamin
Franklin. When Franklin learned that Tadeusz
was skilled in military tactics, and, furthermore,
that it made no particular difference to
him where he strayed, he at once offered to give
him a letter to Washington. Our general was
indeed glad to receive such a valuable aid, and
appointed him colonel of engineers and placed
him upon his staff. Soon his proficiency in fort-building
won for him the honor of scientist of
the American Army. He worked by the side
of Washington for eight years, until he was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
longer needed. Then he returned to Poland,
for his heart was ever there. He gained a
glorious victory, the victory of Raclawie, which
the Polacks can never forget. They have
erected a mound to his honor, and even the
American government has not been ungrateful
to this grand man.</p>

<p>Another Polack, Count Casimir Pulaski, also
served us well in our early struggles; he was
killed at the battle of Savannah in 1779.</p>

<p>Henryk Sienkiewicz has given us some wonderful
masterpieces in literature, and there are
countless other Polish authors who might be
mentioned, but they are too numerous and one
is not as familiar with their works as with those
of Sienkiewicz.</p>

<p>We may linger no longer. The Christmas
season approaches, when we must return to our
own again. Homewards we turn our steps,
with intense regret. We leave behind us the
flat, broad plains of Lekh, we recross the Continent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
take ship at Havre, and are once again
in our beloved America, where we see our poor
happy and comfortable; where all is bustle and
prosperity, and we feel thankful that our independence
has lasted throughout these years and
that no nation may come in and rob us of our
heritage.</p>

<div class='adtitle3'>THE LITTLE COLONEL. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class='small'>(Trade Mark)</span></div>

<p>The scene of this story is laid in Kentucky. Its heroine
is a small girl, who is known as the Little Colonel,
on account of her fancied resemblance to an old-school
Southern gentleman, whose fine estate and old family
are famous in the region.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>THE GIANT SCISSORS.</div>

<p>This is the story of Joyce and of her adventures
in France. Joyce is a great friend of the Little Colonel,
and in later volumes shares with her the delightful experiences
of the "House Party" and the "Holidays."</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>TWO LITTLE KNIGHTS OF KENTUCKY.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Who Were the Little Colonel's Neighbors.</span></p>

<p>In this volume the Little Colonel returns to us like an
old friend, but with added grace and charm. She is
not, however, the central figure of the story, that place
being taken by the "two little knights."</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>MILDRED'S INHERITANCE.</div>

<p>A delightful little story of a lonely English girl who
comes to America and is befriended by a sympathetic
American family who are attracted by her beautiful
speaking voice. By means of this one gift she is enabled
to help a school-girl who has temporarily lost the
use of her eyes, and thus finally her life becomes a busy,
happy one.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>CICELY AND OTHER STORIES FOR GIRLS.</div>

<p>The readers of Mrs. Johnston's charming juveniles
will be glad to learn of the issue of this volume for
young people.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>AUNT 'LIZA'S HERO AND OTHER STORIES.</div>

<p>A collection of six bright little stories, which will
appeal to all boys and most girls.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>BIG BROTHER.</div>

<p>A story of two boys. The devotion and care of
Steven, himself a small boy, for his baby brother, is the
theme of the simple tale.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>OLE MAMMY'S TORMENT.</div>

<p>"Ole Mammy's Torment" has been fitly called "a
classic of Southern life." It relates the haps and mishaps
of a small negro lad, and tells how he was led by
love and kindness to a knowledge of the right.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>THE STORY OF DAGO.</div>

<p>In this story Mrs. Johnston relates the story of Dago,
a pet monkey, owned jointly by two brothers. Dago
tells his own story, and the account of his haps and mishaps
is both interesting and amusing.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>THE QUILT THAT JACK BUILT.</div>

<p>A pleasant little story of a boy's labor of love, and
how it changed the course of his life many years after
it was accomplished.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>FLIP'S ISLANDS OF PROVIDENCE.</div>

<p>A story of a boy's life battle, his early defeat, and his
final triumph, well worth the reading.</p>
